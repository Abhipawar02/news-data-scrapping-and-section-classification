Farhan Akhtar answers Salaar marks a big comeback for Prabhas. The actor has starred in many big-budget projects since the Baahubali films, but they fell way short of the high benchmark that he’d set for himself. Saaho, Radhe Shyam and Adipurush flopped at the box office, and while Prabhas has many other films in the pipeline, the Prashanth Neel film was being seen as a test of Prabhas’ stardom. After Salaar Part 1, he will be seen in the sequel of the film which is scheduled to release in 2025. He is also set to star in Nag Ashwin’s Kalki 2898 AD, Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s Spirit, and director Maruthi’s next.

1,Khushi Kapoor says father Boney Kapoor cried after watching The Archies; Janhvi Kapoor lists what her sister has in common with Sridevi: ‘My biases aside…’,"Sisters Janhvi Kapoor and Khushi Kapoor appeared as guests on the latest episode of Koffee with Karan, and they spoke candidly about their journey in the film business. Khushi also spoke about her family’s reaction to her debut movie. Khushi Kapoor, younger daughter of Boney Kapoor and Sridevi, made her debut with Zoya Akhtar’s The Archies. The film released last month on Netflix, and earned mixed reviews. During the episode, Karan asked Khushi about how she auditioned for the film. “I had just come back from New York, and I had no intention of starting out at that point. so when I went and auditioned, I was fully shaking. It was the first office I went to, first audition I had ever given, so I was scared. She (Zoya) made it really easy for me though, she calmed me down. I was freaking out, but I think it went well,” Khushi said. Indian Express Entertainment is now on WhatsApp Channels. Follow us for the latest news, interviews, reviews, photos and more. Once she landed the coveted part of Betty Cooper in the film, Khushi said she “immediately started howling” and crying. “I knew I wanted to do this for the longest time. In that moment I felt, ‘Okay, now it is happening for me.’ It was with Zoya and was the most ideal situation for me and I got really emotional.” The debutante revealed that Boney Kapoor got so emotional after watching The Archies that he started to cry. Janhvi added, “He cried for three days!” To which Khushi said, “I would get random messages from him saying, ‘You are just so good beta.’ It was really cute and sweet!”     A post shared by Netflix India (@netflix_in) Janhvi, who made her debut in 2018 with Karan Johar-backed Dhadak, said it was an “obviously” emotional moment for her to see Khushi act on screen and then listed what her younger sister has in common with mother Sridevi. “My biases aside, she is phenomenal, she is unreal. I have seen her for nine months, slog her a** off every day in every aspect of the film. She is a very quiet person and that is something she has in common with Mumma. But in front of the camera, she explodes. I didn’t know that all of this was cooking inside. I live with her, but I didn’t know that’s what it could convert to on screen. I really do think she is magical.” Apart from Khushi, The Archies also marked the acting debut of Shah Rukh Khan’s daughter, Suhana, and megastar Amitabh Bachchan’s grandson, Agastya Nanda. Ever since it was first announced, the film was attacked by a section that felt casting star kids in it was encouraging nepotism in the industry. It led to the three debutants being trolled, even before they were seen on screen. “I do read certain things sometimes, I try not to but you can’t help, you want to see what people are saying about you,” Khushi said when asked about trolling. “The first hate comment I read about myself was when I was 11 or 12 years old. Once you keep seeing it, you understand that it is not coming from anything concrete. It is just people taking out their own insecurities on you.” Click for more updates and latest Bollywood news along with Entertainment updates.

2,"Janhvi Kapoor recalls ‘howling’ when she got the call about Sridevi’s death, reveals sister Khushi hasn’t cried since that day: ‘She started comforting me’","When veteran actor Sridevi passed away in February 2018, it was a shock to her family and fans, as she appeared healthy and was only 54 at the time. Janhvi and Khushi, her two daughters, recently appeared on the latest episode of Koffee with Karan and opened up about the day Sridevi passed away. Janhvi recalled that she got the call when she was in her room, and as soon as she hung up, she could hear her sister crying in the room next door. “When I got the call, I was in my room, and I could hear wailing from Khushi’s room, and I think I barged into her room howling and crying. But what I do remember is, she looked at me and the minute she looked at me, she stopped crying. She just stopped crying. She sat next to me and started comforting me. And I have never seen her cry about it since,” Janhvi shared emotionally. Khushi said that even though she is the youngest, she felt like she had to “hold it together” for her family. “I think I felt like I had to hold it together for everyone because I feel like I have always been the strong one,” she shared as Karan said that this was a “tough burden to take at your age.” The sisters also shared that when they “get emotional about things, they don’t show it to each other.” The Archies actor was 18 when Sridevi passed away, and she said that it took her a while to accept her new reality. “It took me a while when it happened to kind of accept it. I think it did suddenly hit me after a while but I was a little confused I don’t know. But I had Janhvi, I had Dad so they were just kind of there to help me,” she said.

She is equally my baby and my mom at times. And I am equally her baby and her mom at times,” Janhvi said as she spoke about her current equation with Khushi.

Follow us for the latest news, interviews, reviews, photos and more. “Ranveer and I love children. We look forward to the day when we will start our own family,” shared Deepika in a chat with Vogue Singapore. Speaking about her family, she added, “When I meet the people I have grown up with—my aunts, uncles, family friends—they always mention how I haven’t changed one bit. That says a lot about our upbringing.” “In this industry, it’s easy to get carried away by fame and money. But no one treats me like a celebrity at home. I am a daughter and a sister first. I don’t want that to change. My family keeps me grounded and Ranveer and I hope to inculcate the same values in our children,” she added. It was back in 2019 when Deepika Padukone made it clear that while she and Ranveer want children, they weren’t thinking about itactively. She had also expressed her annoyance with the societal expectations from couples. “I think it’s sad that society kind of puts itself and people in this rut that okay you are dating for so long toh shaadi kab hogi, shaadi ke baad bacche and then grandchildren. It’s almost like it’s the said expectation. I’m not surprised (by the rumours), we’re not surprised by it at all,” Deepika shared while speaking with HT Cafe. She added, “Do we intent on having children? Of course we do, we both love kids. But do we intent on having children anytime soon? Absolutely not! We’re too selfishly at this point focused on our careers and I don’t think it would be fair to have kids at this point. We’re not even thinking about kids.” On the work front, Deepika awaited the release of her Siddharth Anand film, Fighter. Deepika will be sharing the screen with Hrithik Roshan.

From spilling the beans about their romantic relationships to recalling fond memories of their mother Sridevi, the sisters opened up about their lives on the chat show. Janhvi neither confirmed or denied her rumoured relationship with Shikhar Pahariya, whom she used to date several years ago as well. After breaking up, they were said to have gotten back together recently. Karan asked Janhvi, “You have had an interesting path of love, you were dating Shikhar, and then you dated someone else and now you are dating Shikhar again. True or False?” Janhvi had an interesting answer to Karan’s question. She said, “Have you heard that song, ‘Nadaan Parindey Ghar Aaja’? Shikhar used to sing that to me a lot.” The Bawaal actor continued, “I won’t say that, but I will say this, he is, not just for me, but for her (Khushi), for dad and everyone in our family, he has been there from the start as a friend. Not in a way that made me feel like he is expecting anything or he is a pushover or any of those things. He was just there in a very selfless dignified way, and in a way that I have not seen many men capable of being there for another human being.”     A post shared by Janhvi Kapoor (@janhvikapoor) Karan also questioned Janhvi about about decision to not date actors. For the unversed, Janhvi reportedly dated actor Kartik Aaryan before their falling-out led to the cancellation of the film they were doing together at the time. The duo was spotted together in Goa in 2021. Janhvi revealed on the show that Khushi has hated all her boyfriends except one, and also added that she has only dated three boys. When asked why she would ‘never’ date an actor, Janhvi said, “I want someone to be obsessed with me. The thing is, you need someone to be okay with your… there needs to be a balance. You need someone who is okay to let you have your moment also but I find with actors that they get very competitive and they get very weird. I’ve said never (date actors).” The actor continued, “There is always tension when there is an actor. I can’t deal with that tension because I like to be undyingly devoted and I expect that devotion and I think when you are in the same profession, it’s difficult, specifically this profession.” Khushi, who recently made her debut with Zoya Akhtar’s The Archies, is rumoured to be dating her co-star Vedang Raina.

7,Zarin Shihab on beautifully conveying significant emotions without explosions in Aattam: ‘The most challenging aspects I face…’,"Not many aspiring actors manage to land a launch like Zarin Shihab did back in 2019. Despite having only limited screen time in Raj & DK’s spy thriller series The Family Man, Zarin skillfully portrayed the character Sahaya Mary, a nurse pivotal to the show’s plot, leaving a lasting impression on viewers with her debut performance. Nevertheless, she has been selective in her acting choices, prioritising quality over quantity since then. As a result, Zarin is now gaining significant recognition, especially in her homeland of Kerala, through films and roles that inspire her to push her creative boundaries. The latest addition to her brief yet impressive filmography is Anand Ekarshi’s debut feature Aattam (The Play), which premiered at the 28th IFFK, receiving rave reviews. Now, as the film prepares for its theatrical release on January 5, Zarin, whose performance captivated viewers at IFFK, eagerly anticipates the broader audience’s opinions. At its core, the film revolves around a woman who experiences sexual assault in a space she had considered safe and Zarin plays the role of Anjali, the only female member of a drama troupe called Arangu, comprising 12 male actors along with the director. Mentioning that she was captivated by the project even before they started filming and at the time of auditioning itself, Zarin Shihab said she realised her desire to be a part of Aattam after understanding director Anand Ekarshi’s vision. “Actor Vinay Forrt (who plays a key role in Aattam) was also present during the auditions. There were five shortlisted actors and I was one of them. A top-tier actor like Vinay making himself available for auditions with shortlisted candidates does not happen often. Also, the project appeared highly intense right from the start, solidifying my certainty that I wanted to be involved in it from that very moment,” she told The Indian Express. One notable strength of Aattam, which ensures a seamless fusion of play and film, lies in the extensive theatre backgrounds of almost all the actors. Zarin herself has done theatre for seven years. However, aside from her and Shajohn, all others are seasoned theatre artistes with a minimum of 15-20 years of experience. Despite finding it initially challenging to meet these actors at the bar they were accustomed to performing, she noted that the 35-40 day workshop before filming proved significantly helpful. “Here, you are essentially performing a play within a film. The veterans in Aattam, drawing from their experience in classic Malayalam dramas, exhibit exceptional physical movements. The most experience I had in that aspect was through Kalaripayattu. So, the rehearsals helped a lot.” Though the movie includes outdoor scenes too, a notable part of it unravels inside a house, showcasing character interactions, discussions and verbal conflicts, making Aattam a chamber drama as well, alongside its various other elements. For Zarin Shihab, embodying the character Anjali posed a major challenge due to the film’s dialogue-heavy nature and extensive back-and-forth exchanges. “Another difficulty I encounter as an actor is that when someone delivers an exceptional performance in front of me, I tend to become absorbed in it. The sheer brilliance unfolding before me draws me away from my own character and headspace. In Aattam, it happened quite a few times and I sometimes found myself temporarily adrift and needed to refocus on the present moment,” she recalled. Zarin expressed gratitude to Aattam for instilling in her a more disciplined approach to her work and for encouraging her to view acting as a profession without romanticising it. “When you approach it as a job, your life becomes more disciplined. With discipline, you can achieve more enduring and fruitful results,” she explained. As the first member in her family to enter the film industry and that too without any prior connections, Zarin noted that this disciplined mindset also contributed to fostering better relationships with her colleagues.     A post shared by Joy Movie Productions (@joymovieproductions) When asked about the most touching response she received for Aattam at IFFK, Zarin shared a comment from a viewer expressing that there was a profound truth in her performance. For Zarin Shihab, the 28th IFFK was also an event that celebrated her acting choices and prowess. Besides Aattam, Shruthi Sharanyam’s B 32 Muthal 44 Vare, another film in which she played a significant role, was screened at the fest and garnered substantial praise. While her performances in both movies were consistently spectacular, she particularly excelled when her characters had to convey inner turmoil with limited expressive freedom. When discussing her approach to challenging acting moments, where conveying significant emotions is required with minimal means, Zarin emphasised that in both cases, the respective filmmakers consciously avoided making the conflicts explosive. “Emotional explosions are easy, right? This is harder to pull off for both the performer and the technical crew since it requires more clarity on how to enhance the moment through other aspects of filmmaking. I don’t think any other reaction, like a proper external one, would have worked better in that moment,” she said. “For me, the most challenging aspects on set involve the physical conditions of heat, hunger, lack of sleep etc. Earlier, I used to easily get distracted by these factors. But now, I use such discomforts to enhance my performance and turn them into assets,” Zarin added. At their core, both Aattam and B 32 Muthal 44 Vare address workplace harassment — a subject films intentionally avoided in the past. Nonetheless, these films underline that there’s a gradual shift in addressing such matters. When asked if cinema can inspire societal changes, Zarin elaborated, “I am still trying to ascertain whether that is actually possible. I still perceive movies as a form of escape, though not as grandiose as the escapism offered by movies like Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani. Although Aattam belongs to a very intense zone, it still engages people. Despite not being an easy or comfortable watch, it manages to entertain. However, it also encourages people to pose questions for which we may lack answers and sparks a dialogue among viewers. I believe the most impactful movies are those that linger with you even after leaving the theatres. Although cinema is a significant medium with broad reach, I don’t believe it’s reasonable to anticipate social change or impact from such a medium.”     A post shared by Joy Movie Productions (@joymovieproductions) Before landing such significant roles in Malayalam, Zarin Shihab also appeared in the series Jugaadistan and the Bollywood sports drama Rashmi Rocket, among other works, and lent her voice to the podcast Darr Ka Raaz with Dr Phobia, balancing between different mediums. Despite this, she emphasises that working in Malayalam has always been her dream, and the transition to this industry was intentional. “When I auditioned for Family Man in 2018, the OTT boom had just started in the country. I didn’t know what I was auditioning for. They didn’t inform me that it was a Prime series or that it featured Manoj Bajpayee. Nevertheless, it was received very well. Even in the midst of that success, I knew I wanted to work in Kerala and be a part of the Malayalam industry.” However, The Family Man was not her first-ever step toward fulfilling her dream of becoming an actor. Since her early 20s, Zarin has been diligently working for it, and even during college, she was actively involved in theatre and participated in short films. “I always believed that with hard work and persistence, something positive will unfold, even if you might not be able to quantify or identify it accurately at that moment.” When queried about the projects she is most enthusiastic about in her current lineup, Zarin mentioned having two works. The first is a movie titled Ithiri Neram, directed by Prasanth Vijay, where Zarin will share the screen with Roshan Mathew. Additionally, she is also playing a key role in a web series helmed by Krishand, known for films like Aavasavyuham and Purusha Pretham. “Ithiri Neram is a delightful slice-of-life movie depicting the reunion of two exes after a long period. It ventures away from the intense, serious zones I am typically associated with in acting (laughs). The shoot for Krishand’s web series will begin in January and I am quite excited about that too,” she signs off.",Entertainment,zarin shihab beautifully convey significant emotions without explosions

8,"How would Dil Chahta Hai’s Sid, Sameer and Akash be had Instagram existed? Farhan Akhtar answers","Imagine Dil Chahta Hai, but with Instagram aesthetics? Actor-filmmaker Farhan Akhtar says his 2001 directorial debut starring Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna would have been an “entirely” different film if social media existed during the time it was made. Dil Chahta Hai followed the lives of three college graduates, as they navigate personal challenges which test their friendship. It is often regarded as a landmark Hindi film and perhaps the start of many friendship-based stories, especially coming from Farhan Akhtar and Ritesh Sidhwani’s production house Excel Entertainment (Rock On, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara). Indian Express Entertainment is now on WhatsApp Channels. Follow us for the latest news, interviews, reviews, photos and more. The duo has now co-produced the latest Netflix film, Kho Gaye Hum Kahan, which is billed as a coming of ‘digital’ age drama. It is co-produced by Zoya Akhtar and Reema Kagti, who have also written the film along with director Arjun Varain Singh. Kho Gaye Hum Kahan features a brief sequence, where the three friends–Ananya Panday, Siddhanth Chaturvedi and Adarsh Gourav–also go on a Goa trip, similar to that in Dil Chahta Hai. When asked what would the film be like if Instagram had made its way into the lives of Dil Chahta Hai characters, Farhan told Indianexpress.com, “They definitely would have posted the Goa meme where the three of them are sitting on their own! But it would have been a completely different film if there was all that what we have now.” Farhan was joined by Reema, Zoya, Ritesh, Arjun and Ruchikaa Kapoor Sheikh, director, Original Films, Netflix India at the roundtable. Adding to Farhan’s answer, Reema said, “The film then would have been Kho Gaye Hum Kahan!”, to which the actor added, “It could have very much been possible, yes.” Watch:     A post shared by Indian Express Entertainment (@ieentertainment) The new Netflix film aims to celebrate the power of friendship in the fast-paced era of social media, as it follows three best friends in their 20s navigating their life and striving to balance their online identities with their true selves. Putting one’s life and art out on social media can be quite daunting, especially for public personalities and Farhan Akhtar says he is aware of the perils. There was a time the actor-filmmaker says trolling did bother him, but it doesn’t rattle him anymore today. “I have somehow successfully managed to weed out the need to really consider what everybody is saying all the time. It is also, what is known as, your own negative bias. People say 10 good things, but that one bad thing starts circulating in your head. I felt it is not healthy to do that to yourself. “Whether it is a piece of work, a reel or an image that you have put out, you have put it out there because it has something you are happy sharing with people. That’s where your attachment with it should end. Then whatever people want to say and do with it, that’s their own thing. I don’t get into reading the comments, honestly it doesn’t bother me anymore, at all,” he added. Click for more updates and latest Bollywood news along with Entertainment updates.

10,Abraham Ozler: Jayaram looks promising as a quintessential brooding investigator in this crime drama,"Director Midhun Manuel Thomas is back to his grind with Abraham Ozler. The trailer of the film introduces you to a brooding titular character who seems to be guilt-ridden. We learn he keeps bringing food to a culprit in a prison. Though the reason behind the gesture is unknown, it hints at a dark past to Ozler, who is currently an insomniac and is on the edge. In one instance, he says there is no place even in hell for people like him. And then comes an unsolvable case. Will it absolve him of his past sins or will it awaken the suppressed trauma? Looks like Midhun’s upcoming film travels the familiar landscape of such crime dramas, but it is intriguing to see Jayaram in such a role, who seems to be pretty comfortable in it. Largely known for his comic sense, Jayaram aces this dark territory too. Initially, the team of Abraham Ozler was planning to have a trailer launch event to unveil the promo. However, they chose to donate the money to a 15-year-old dairy farmer in Kerala, who lost 13 cows due to food poisoning. Jayaram visited the house of the farmer and donated Rs 5 lakh. Actors Prithviraj and Mammootty have also donated a huge sum. Meanwhile, Abraham Ozler, set to be released on January 11, also stars Anaswara Rajan, Sai Kumar, Arjun Ashokan, and Jagadish in important roles.",Entertainment,abraham ozler jayaram look promise quintessential brood investigator crime drama director midhun manuel thomas back grind abraham ozler trailer film introduce brood titular character seem guiltridden learn keep bring food culprit prison though reason behind gesture unknown hint dark past ozler currently insomniac edge one instance say place even hell people like come unsolvable case absolve past sin awaken suppress trauma look like midhuns upcoming film travel familiar landscape crime dramas intrigue see jayaram role seem pretty comfortable largely know comic sense jayaram ace dark territory initially team abraham ozler plan trailer launch event unveil promo however choose donate money yearold dairy farmer kerala lose cow due food poison jayaram visit house farmer donate rs lakh actors prithviraj mammootty also donate huge sum meanwhile abraham ozler set release january also star anaswara rajan sai kumar arjun ashokan jagadish important roles,1

13,Vikrant Massey says he would ‘continue weeping’ even after Vidhu Vinod Chopra cut the shot during 12th Fail: ‘I just couldn’t control myself’,"Vikrant Massey was recently seen in one of the most successful films of the year, 12th Fail. In a recent interview, the actor shared that some characters have a hold on the actor and it is difficult to detach oneself from those characters. In 12th Fail, Vikrant played the role of Manoj Kumar Sharma who fights against all odds to crack the UPSC exam. In a chat with ANI, Vikrant also spoke about the hold of his character in A Death in the Gunj that really disturbed him. “Some characters… you just want to tear them apart because they stay with you. What I did in A Death in the Gunj, really stayed with me,” he shared and added, “That was the first time, after filming that film, I started taking therapy because I felt I needed to talk to someone. If you tell your parents about your worries, then they get worried so you really can’t share all these things with them. Because it was a very dark film. It pushed me to certain darker corners.” Vikrant Massey then spoke about his character in 12th Fail that affected him strongly. “Even with Manoj Kumar Sharma, there were moments when Vinod sir would call a cut and I would continue weeping even after the cut is called because I just could not control myself,” he said. ALSO READ | Sharmila Tagore recalls how Tiger Pataudi asked her out for the first time, she thought ‘I’ll go to jail’: ‘I was very flustered’ 12th Fail, directed by Vidhu Vinod Chopra, starred Vikrant in the lead role. In a recent Instagram post, Vikrant called the director his “light at the end of the tunnel”.     A post shared by Vikrant Massey (@vikrantmassey) In another interview with Galatta Plus, actor Abhishek Bachchan credited Vikrant Massey for making the biggest hit of the year based on return of investment. “Vikrant has given a great example of a small film with a big heart working, but with all due respect, I’m not sure what his budget would’ve been. But it can’t have been more than single-digits, or Rs 10-12 crore,” he said and added, “It’s not possible for a film like that, because of the system, to do Rs 500 crore. He doesn’t have those kind of theatres. The amount of people he’s managed to show the film to is because he has a particular number of theatres, so it’s occupancy percentage will be very high. You can’t expect him to compete with a Jawan, which is made on a budget of possible 20x of what his budget was. And, it’s Mr Shah Rukh Khan, who’s one of the biggest stars that the nation has ever seen. Every film has its own quantum, but if you see percentage ROI, I’m sure (Vikrant) has got the biggest hit of the year.” 12th Fail made over Rs 70 crore worldwide gross.

15,"First Pooh, now Mickey. In public domain, early Mickey Mouse version will star in horror movies","Slashed free of Disney’s copyright as of Monday, the iconic character from Steamboat Willie is already the focus of two horror films. On Monday, just hours after the 1928 short entered the public domain, a trailer for Mickey’s Mouse Trap dropped on YouTube. Another yet-to-be-titled film was announced Tuesday. Steamboat Willie featured early versions of both Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks, it was the third cartoon featuring the duo they made but the first to be released. In it, a more menacing Mickey, bearing more resemblance to rat than mouse, captains a boat and makes musical instruments out of other animals. It’s perhaps fitting, then, that the first projects announced are seemingly low-budget and campy slasher movies — and not unprecedented. Winnie the Pooh — sans red shirt — entered the public domain in 2022; scarcely a year later, he was notching up a heavy body count in the microbudget Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey. In the trailer for Mickey’s Mouse Trap, directed by Jamie Bailey, what appears to be a human in a comically small Mickey mask terrorizes a group of young people at an arcade. “A place for fun. A place for friends. A place for hunting,” text flashed during the trailer reads. The mouse is out. “We just wanted to have fun with it all. I mean it’s Steamboat Willie’s Mickey Mouse murdering people,” director Jamie Bailey said in a statement cited by trade publications. “It’s ridiculous. We ran with it and had fun doing it and I think it shows.” No release date has been set. The second movie is from director Steven LaMorte, who previously directed a horror parody of The Grinch, which is not in the public domain (the movie is thus called The Mean One). “A late-night boat ride turns into a desperate fight for survival in New York City when a mischievous mouse becomes a monstrous reality,” is the logline for the untitled film, per a post on LaMorte’s Instagram. “Steamboat Willie has brought joy to generations, but beneath that cheerful exterior lies a potential for pure, unhinged terror,” LaMorte said in a release cited by the trades. The movie has yet to begin production. With the expiration of the 95-year copyright, the public is allowed to use only the initial versions of Mickey and Minnie — not the more familiar character designs. “We will, of course, continue to protect our rights in the more modern versions of Mickey Mouse and other works that remain subject to copyright,” Disney said in a statement ahead of the characters entering the public domain. LaMorte told Variety that the producers of his film are working with a legal team so as not to run afoul of Disney, and will call their raging rodent Steamboat Willie instead of Mickey Mouse. “We are doing our due diligence to make sure there’s no question or confusion of what we’re up to,” he said.

Sharmila shared that was she was a fan of the cricketer and he played a prank on her to ask her out. When Amitabh Bachchan asked her about how their love story started, Sharmila recalled how they first met and exchanged phone numbers. Sharmila shared, “I was a cricket fan, not a cricket fan, cricketer fan. We met at a cricket party in Kolkata and then we exchanged telephone numbers.” The Gulmohur actor recalled that she was going to Nainital for the shooting of Yash Chopra’s Waqt when Tiger had hit a double century in Delhi. She called him to congratulate on his big success but since he wasn’t home, she left him a message. “After a few months, in Mumbai, there was a funny call that there are five air conditioners for you from London. And at that time, all the imported things were banned. I said someone is trying to get me into trouble, I’ll go to jail. I was very flustered,” she recalled. There was a telephone number attached with the message and when she called that number, she found that this was all done by Tiger.

It was a joke, that kind of joke. That’s how it happened. He said, ‘Can we go out for coffee?’ I said, ‘Yeah, we’ll go out for coffee.’ That was that. We never stopped,” she shared with a smile. Sharmila Tagore and Mansoor Ali Khan got married in 1968 and stayed together until his passing in 2011. In an earlier interview with Ladies Study Group (a book club in Kolkata), Sharmila said that she liked Tiger’s sense of humour and she knew that he would never hurt her. “I met him in around 1965 at somebody’s party. There we got to talk to each other. He had a very British accent and nobody would laugh at his jokes since they didn’t understand them. So, he used to laugh at his jokes himself.” Sharing why she married him, she said, “I liked his sense of humour and I knew this man won’t hurt me on purpose.

Sharmila, who also appeared on Koffee with Karan with Saif Ali Khan recently, recalled an anecdote from a couple of decades ago when Ibrahim Ali Khan was born. Ibrahim is the son of Saif and his first wife Amrita Singh. Amitabh asked Sharmila and Sara a fan question that required them to answer who was the most entitled person in the Pataudi family. To this, Sharmila answered with Sara’s name. When asked to elaborate, Sharmila said, “When Ibrahim was born, I gave my earrings, which I wore for my wedding, to Amrita as that when Ibrahim grows up, it will be for his wife. Guess who has taken it?” Upon hearing this, Big B asked if it was Sara who has taken them and she nodded in agreement. Sharmila further added, “Like Ibrahim has nothing to do with it.

20,Complaint filed against Lokesh Kanagaraj for violence in his films: ‘He should be examined psychologically’,"Lokesh Kanagaraj, Nelson Dilipkumar, Vetrimaaran, and Arun Matheshwaran are some of the directors who are facing criticism for excessive violence in their films. Among the lot, Lokesh faces the most disparaging comments for the violence in his cinematic universe called Lokesh Cinematic Universe, which comprises films Vikram, Leo, and Kaithi. In a recent development, a complaint has been filed against the director at Madurai Court for allegedly inciting violence through his films. According to a report published in India Today, a petitioner named Raja Murugan has filed a complaint against the director for his violent films. The petitioner also asked for a psychological examination of Lokesh because of the violence in his films. The petitioner claimed that Lokesh Kanagaraj’s films might encourage youngsters to commit crimes shown in the director’s films like drug abuse and physical violence. He further asked the Central Board of Film Certification to be more vigil while certifying films and censoring content. Lokesh’s latest release Leo, starring Vijay, is based on the Hollywood film named A History of Violence. The movie was about a family man who has a bloody past. ‘Bloody Sweet’ is the tagline of the film, which has many violent action sequences, which have become a trend in Tamil cinema. Earlier, when asked about the violence in his films, Lokesh Kanagaraj said, “‘Because it is fun’. Yes, there’s fun in that. If we get to see two people stabbing each other in real life, we will turn our heads away, because we know it is not fun.

22,Jeetendra recalls how Rekha endorsed Sridevi even before the latter made her Hindi film debut: ‘Rekha was suppose to star in Himaatwala’,"Sridevi, an icon star of Indian cinema, was remembered and celebrated by Bollywood celebrities and her family members on her 60th birth anniversary last August. Recently, an intriguing old interview clip featuring veteran actor Jeetendra was circulating on social media, shedding light on how Rekha recommended him to work with Sridevi even before the latter made her Hindi film debut. In an interview with Zoom, Jeetendra shared the story of how Rekha suggested him to work with Sridevi while they were watching a Telugu film featuring the late actor. Recounting the incident, Jeetendra said, “One time me and Rekha were watching a Telugu film (which starred Sridevi). Rekha was suppose to play the female lead in Himaatwala at the time. While we were watching the Telugu film, Rekha kept telling me that, ‘You should work with her.’ I told her I will definitely work with her. I think Rekha couldn’t give her dates for Himaatwala and then the film’s director K Raghavendra Rao said let’s take Sridevi.” Indian Express Entertainment is now on WhatsApp Channels. Follow us for the latest news, interviews, reviews, photos and more. Speaking of Sridevi’s exceptional dancing skills, Jeetandra said, “When dance master used to teach us the steps, she would learn it quickly in just two rehearsals, while I took more time. She would rehearse with me until I perfected my steps.” Sridevi, already an established star in Telugu and Tamil cinema, made her Hindi film debut with the 1972 film Rani Mera Naam. Her collaboration with Jeetendra began with the 1983 film Himmatwala, a remake of the Telugu film Ooruki Monagadu (1981). The movie, featuring Jeetendra and Sridevi in lead roles, turned out to be a massive commercial success, grossing Rs 5 crore and becoming one of the highest-grossing Hindi films of the 1980s. Himmatwala proved to be a breakthrough moment for Sridevi in Bollywood, catapulting her to stardom, with her dance number “Naino Mein Sapna” becoming a sensation.

23,"When Amitabh Bachchan ran into a fire to save wheelchair-bound Tabassum, saved her life: ‘I was shouting for help…’","Amitabh Bachchan has performed many heroic stunts in his movies but not many know that Big B is just as heroic in his real-life as well. Bachchan has walked across fire, jumped from top of tall buildings and even faced a near-fatal accident during his movies but these experiences helped him in becoming a person who was fearless in the time of crisis. In a 2014 interview, late film interviewer Tabassum, who hosted the Doordarshan talk show Phool Khile Hain Gulshan Gulshan, shared that Amitabh once saved her life when a fire broke out. Tabassum said that she had done many live stage shows with Bachchan but once, during a show in Mumbai, a fire broke out. “This took place at Shanmukhananda Hall in Mumbai. I was sitting in a wheelchair and conducting the show as my leg was fractured. Suddenly, there was a fire and that caused a stampede. I started shouting for help. Nobody responded. They were all running for their lives. Then Amitji came. He took me to a safe place. Today, I am alive because of him,” she told Rediff.com.

24,"Salaar Movie Review: Prabhas’ violence-riddled film is all noise, meaning very little","Salaar Movie Review: It’s tempting to dub ‘Salaar Part One’ ‘KGF’ Redux, except it is bigger and bloodier. It is bathed in the same colour palette — shades of black limned with red. It has the same appetite for violence, with a higher body count. And instead of one hero, it has two, Prabhas and Prithviraj, playing childhood best friends whose primary job as able-bodied adults is to cleave through flesh, and lop off heads: let it not be said that Prashanth Neel doesn’t have a taste for blood. No, let it not. Let it also not be said that Neel doesn’t have the gift for world-building. The fictional ‘Khansaar’, an outpost somewhere in India which doesn’t follow any rules except its own, is impressive. It is ruled by a king (Jagapathi Babu) who has clawed his way to the throne after having decimated challenges from the two rival tribes that have lived there for ‘a thousand years’: the figure is used in the film enough times to give it a proper little epical ring. Just like KGF, this one too has palaces and hovels, the former in which the rulers live with their well-dressed cohorts; the hutments are populated by women in earthy red raiments who exist simply to wail and weep when one amongst them is chosen to be defiled by a vile ruler. We are given a solo segment, spoiler alert, in which the weepers and wailers get their revenge, but only after we have cringed our way through a grown predator towering over a cowering underage girl, and of course only after the male saviour shows up in a rescue act, which ends badly, of course, for the bad guy. It’s almost redundant to say this, but even the women with slighter bigger speaking parts, are either wide-eyed damsels in distress (Shruti Haasan) or long-suffering maternal figures (Easwari Rao) who feed hulking men food cooked with their own hands on demand. There’s also the comparatively commanding figure of the king’s daughter (Sriya Reddy) who sweeps about in her robes, but moves aside when the real business of the film gets underway. Which is, of course, the relationship between the two leading men, Deva (Prabhas) and Vardha (Prithviraj Sukumaran) and the conflict that arises from their actions. The deep bond between the two men is borrowed from so many epic jodis, especially the Krishna-Sudama pair, and you know that the time will come for one of them to make the ultimate sacrifice for the other. Prabhas, channeling his massive ‘Bahubali’ physique, starts off dour, and then is given a chance to get some movement in his face; Prithviraj has the slightly more complex part, and makes the most of it : when these two are on screen, they make you look. ALSO READ | Salaar Release and Review Live Updates: First reviews call Prabhas-starrer ‘a monster blockbuster’, day 1 box office to be over Rs 50 cr For the rest, you quickly get desensitised to the violence playing out: how many bloody stumps can make you sick? Neel’s universe is a perverse utopia featuring powerful Indian satraps out of the ambit of the state (shades of KGF here as well) can whistle up global militia, from Russia and Sudan and other current war-ridden hot-spots. Jackboots on the floor, greenish berets on the head, men playing violent games to kill and maim and rape: is ‘Khansaar’ as fictional as it seems? Till the violence is comic-book and ‘Games Of Thrones’-type stylised, you can find a way to rationalise it; the trouble ratchets up when it becomes more ‘real’. Salaar Part 2 promises more, more, more. Are we ready for it? Most of part one is eye-glazing enough, making you numb to the murder and mayhem: all noise, meaning very little.

25,Dunki Review: Shah Rukh Khan’s collaboration with Rajkumar Hirani is a crashing bore,"Shah Rukh Khan’s Dunki Movie Review: In ‘Dunki’, Shah Rukh Khan plays a soldier yet again this year after ‘Pathaan’ and ‘Jawaan’, but this third time around turns out to be unlucky: his vaunted first collaboration with Rajkumar Hirani is mostly a crashing bore. ‘Dunki maarna’ is a colloquialism for illegal migration. In the film, Hardyal Singh Dhillon aka Hardy (Shah Rukh Khan) is the catalyst which gets the Laltu threesome of Mannu (Taapsee Pannu), Buggu (Vikram Kochhar) and Balli (Anil Grover) going, through dangerous underwater and overland terrain in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, onwards to their dream destination, London. ALSO READ | Dunki Release and Review Live Updates: Fans say Shah Rukh Khan set to hit hat-trick of hits in 2023, day 1 box office collection to be over Rs 30 cr But before that, it’s all about their hardscrabble lives in a fictional Punjab village, and their attempts to crack the UK visa tangle via small-time agents. Hirani regular Boman Irani plays the jolly English teacher whose jokes refuse to land. The problems of walking-and-talking Ingliss, the snarky interviews, the rejections, should have been classic Hirani territory, in which he effortlessly creates his fabulous fabulism. But this is a decidedly jaded Hirani, who continues to miss the mark through ‘Dunki’, which comes off as a version of Mind Your Language combined with a sort of reverse Purab-aur-Paschim. In the past, Hirani has made us willingly swallow the most improbable elements; we have fallen hook, line, sinker for his colourful and charismatic characters. A 45-year-old star has reeled us in as a 20-something student in ‘Three Idiots’; the same actor has made us believe that he can be a googly-eyed alien in ‘PK’. Medical science firmly put aside, Hirani’s magical sleight-of-hands have helped deliver babies, and cured crusty hospital deans (Munna Bhai MBBS) of their nastiness. We know what Hirani did there, but we have been putty in his capable hands. Most importantly, Hirani has proved that he is a master storyteller, unafraid of diving into emotion. He is equally unafraid of creating scenes which go straight for our heart-strings. But I was hard put in the 161 minutes of ‘Dunki’s run-time to find anything that made me feel anything other than plain boredom or annoyance. It isn’t as if Shah Rukh’s Hardy is not in practically every scene: unlike the larger-than-life figure of his two 2023 blockbusters, this is a zameen-se-juda hero who is better at flinging people over his shoulder in an ‘akhada’ than pumping out bullets from fancy machinery. He is also a knight-in-armour for the spry Mannu, but despite a few mildly-nice moments between the two, he comes off as working too hard for not enough pay-off. Even the money-shot in the movie, in which he is again channelling his real self, where he gets to declare that no, he is not in danger in his own ‘watan’, passes by without any weight. After ‘Pathaan’ and ‘Jawan’, SRK is once again the patriot who will embrace his country, warts and all: it should have been the moment where you are left with a lump in the throat. It passed. The writing is shockingly flat : whatever happened to the Hirani-Abhijat Joshi zest? The only one who leaves an impact is Vicky Kaushal: his brief but memorable arc reminds you of the earlier Hirani who could make you laugh and cry. But this one? No fun, sorry hun.

26,Neru movie review: Mohanlal has started his journey back,"Most crime thrillers, at least in recent times, usually end on a “high” note with the previously elusive and unidentified culprit being apprehended by the infallible hero cop. But what happens to these culprits after that? Do they receive the deserved punishment? Are the victims granted timely justice? Or do these wrongdoers manipulate the system, tipping the scales in their favour, and resurface in society even more formidable? As vital as the investigative phase is to a case, the trial holds equal, if not greater, importance as it ultimately determines the final verdict. However, observing this process unfold in a two to two-and-a-half-hour film may not be inherently engaging, which is why courtroom scenes in cinema tend to be exaggerated, sometimes even lacking coherence. Nevertheless, with his Mohanlal-starrer Neru, director Jeethu Joseph has made an attempt to navigate the realm of courtroom drama with an emphasis on accuracy yet without compromising emotional depth; but its effectiveness is somewhat questionable. Centred on a case involving the rape of a woman with visual impairment in her home when no one else was present, Neru primarily revolves around her and her lawyer’s efforts to prove before the judiciary that the man she identified, through senses of touch and hearing, is indeed the perpetrator. Since a significant portion of the movie unfolds in the courtroom, meticulously exploring each stage of the trial process, Jeethu begins the film at the case’s outset, when Thumba police circle inspector Paul Varghese (Ganesh Kumar) learns about the incident. In these segments, the film handles the subject with utmost care, avoiding problematic portrayals or extremely graphic visuals of assault, in contrast to most films with a similar case at the centre. Though visually impaired, Sara (Anaswara Rajan) is a skilled sculptor, just like her stepfather Mohammed (Jagadish). Thus, even without technically seeing the perpetrator, Sara creates a clay sculpture of him based on her recollections of his facial features and thus the family recognises the man, Michael (Sankar Induchoodan), and informs the CI, leading to his eventual arrest. However, hailing from an affluent family, Michael gets renowned Supreme Court lawyer Rajasekhararan (Siddique) to represent him. Meanwhile, Mohammed and Paul realise that their government-assigned public prosecutor is loyal to Rajasekhararan, prompting their search for a special PP. With the assistance of a former court employee, Ahana (Santhi Mayadevi), they approach Vijayamohan (Mohanlal), a former courtroom firebrand who had abandoned the practice after an unfortunate incident. Despite lacking confidence in appearing for the trial, Vijayamohan takes on the case, moved by Sara’s determination and helplessness. The rest of the film follows his efforts to prove Michael’s guilt in court. While the film begins impressively, providing insights into a case not previously explored in Malayalam cinema, and maintains a deliberate pace consistent with its genre to avoid abrupt disruptions, writers Santhi Mayadevi and Jeethu Joseph are unable to fully capture the essence of the moments right from the start. Despite the script’s meticulous attention to detail, mirroring the filmmaker’s previous works, both within and outside the courtroom, every scene in the film seems somewhat incomplete due to a lack of refined writing. From Sara’s post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), her parents’ sense of helplessness and Vijayamohan’s fear to take up the case, to the lawyer-survivor bond, the shrewdness of a formidable defence attorney and the affluence of the culprit, the writers successfully incorporate gripping elements into the script. Yet, every moment in Neru lacks the impactful resonance it should have carried as the writing fails to deliver a strong punch. This is not to suggest that Neru should have aimed to be a thriller. Absolutely not! Even within its courtroom drama setting, Neru’s narrative unfortunately falls short in fully capitalising on the numerous potential impactful moments, leaving them feeling underdeveloped upon reflection. This includes instances like the interval block, shifts in the trial’s course, revelation moments and what could have been high points — all passing without reaching their full potential. However, one of the notable strength of Neru lies in its avoidance of the typical dramatic courtroom moments, previously seen in Malayalam films like Jana Gana Mana (2022) and Queen (2018), where a star or well-known actor portraying the lawyer delivers a powerful speech that alters the case’s trajectory, leading the court to “acknowledge its errors”. Instead, Neru skillfully concentrates on the intricacies and monotony of a trial, steering clear of providing either Vijayamohan or Sara the chance to turn the courtroom into a platform to showcase their skills in acting or delivering monologues. Nevertheless, even in the film’s technical aspects, Jeethu Joseph fails to offer anything significant, although he ensures the movie remains stable without any major flaws. Unfortunately, its inability to surpass a level of above-average is regrettable. In the midst of all these, it is Mohanlal’s performance, notably better than his recent lacklustre ones, that makes Neru’s 150-minute runtime feel less prolonged. By fully immersing himself in the narrative and the filmmaker’s vision, Mohanlal avoids letting his star persona become a burden to the story. He adeptly portrays the role of Vijayamohan with precision, balancing the character’s vulnerability and abilities without overshadowing Vijayamohan’s ordinary nature. Following a pivotal moment in the film, a simple Vijayamohan is depicted walking out of the court among numerous other lawyers, onto the road, seamlessly blending with the crowd outside and almost becoming invisible. It is this Mohanlal that he had seemingly forgotten and denied the viewers for many years. Witnessing a stellar actor like him making promises about a potential comeback as a powerhouse performer is genuinely satisfying and one can only hope he doesn’t lose his way on this journey. In contrast to her recent roles, Anaswara Rajan excels in her portrayal of Sara, demonstrating great care and effort. The dedication she has invested in doing justice to the character is evident throughout, deserving praise even when her efforts are occasionally inadequate. Siddique, Jagadish, Ganesh Kumar and Sreedhanya also deliver memorable performances, but Priyamani fails to contribute meaningfully due to the lack of depth in her character. This issue extends beyond her, as Neru’s script falls short in providing sufficient development for several characters. For instance, Michael’s mother, initially portrayed as adamant about his acquittal, is not explored further. Even Michael’s father briefly appears before disappearing entirely from the screen, creating the impression that the case is primarily contested between the two lawyers. Santhi Mayadevi’s performance also comes across as somewhat amateur. Though Vishnu Shyam’s music enhances the film in most portions, it becomes loud at some points, lacking consistency. Meanwhile, Satheesh Kurup’s cinematography works in favour of the movie quite well, especially by not giving off the feeling that almost the entire movie unfolds inside a room.

27,Rebel Moon movie review: Zack Snyder’s spectacularly dull sci-fi epic is the worst film of his career,"Whatever the tonnage of the cash-laden trucks that Netflix presumably backed into Anthony Hopkins’ garage before parachuting him in to save the indefensibly dull Rebel Moon at the last moment, it wasn’t enough. The recent Oscar winner has seen it all in his day — he once played a Transformers historian, for Optimus Prime’s sake — but you’d be hard pressed to find a project in which he was as underutilised as he is in director Zack Snyder’s latest eye-sore. Hopkins is literally reduced to an exposition device, in a movie where one character greets another not with a customary ‘hello’, but with, “You’re the legendary assassin known only by the name of Nemesis. Assassinated 16 high ranking imperial officers and their security detail, all in a hunt to avenge your slaughtered children.” What? Also read – The Archies: Zoya Akhtar’s politically-charged film will be triggering for the Animal army Even the film’s protagonist, a rebel warrior named Kora (Sofia Boutella), isn’t spared from having to deliver lines like this. In one of her first scenes, she tells her friend, “I am a child of war… the very idea of family was beaten out of me.” They literally live in the same house; did he not know? Snyder is hardly known for his writing — more than his usual visual ticks, the director’s biggest tell is probably getting one of his characters to say the words, ‘the why of’ — but Rebel Moon often feels like a first-draft. It’s uncommonly lousy, even by his standards. The filmmaker might cite respectable influences such as George Lucas and Akira Kurosawa, but you’ll never catch him admitting that Rebel Moon actually seems like it has been cobbled together from the rubble of his nemesis Joss Whedon’s short-lived television series, Firefly. Set in an alien universe ruled by a fascist regime — there’s frankly too much lore to keep track of — the movie opens on a peaceful planet named Veldt. This is where Kora has been living as a farmer for a couple of years, after having been discovered in the wreckage of a spaceship in the aftermath of a war. Unbeknownst to the imperial regime, the citizens of Veldt are living on some of the most fertile farmland in the entire universe. But their cover is blown one day, when a squadron of soldiers arrives unannounced, and demands the entirety of their produce. Ed Skrein plays the commandant, Atticus Noble, as a cross between Colonel Hans Landa from Inglourious Basterds and Captain Russell from Lagaan. In his cruel demands, there are echoes of the Bengal famine, when British colonialists stole from India to feed their people and fund their war, leaving millions dead. Snyder makes the odd decision to portray Kora as a reluctant hero, but after having backed himself into a corner, decides that she cannot remain passive any longer. As expected, Kora turns on a dime and finds the motivation to fight back after witnessing villainy firsthand. It’s disappointing to note that even now — years after being pummeled for the gender politics in Sucker Punch — Snyder relies on violence against women as a narrative trope to propel his plots. In Rebel Moon, Kora kicks into gear only after watching one of her friends nearly get gang-raped by the Nazi cosplayers who serve as the film’s antagonists. Snyder also somehow finds a way to be homophobic in this faraway fantasy land — an impossible feat, you’d imagine, seeing as we’re talking about a world in which Jena Malone plays a humanoid spider-woman. But there you have it. The ugliness of Rebel Moon isn’t limited to its visuals. It’s probably worth pointing out that Kora doesn’t lead the fight against the imperialists herself, but chooses instead to put together a ragtag team of warriors. She is joined on her quest by her suitor, a man named Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), and subsequently by a Han Solo-esque rogue named Kai, played by Charlie Hunnam with, who knows why, a Northern Irish accent. Rebel Moon’s origins as a Star Wars project are apparent. In addition to the shameless use of lightsabers and the Solo stand-in, Snyder also sends his protagonists to a cantina-style hive of scum and villainy, populated by skeevy characters whose faces seem to have been fashioned out of leftover prosthetics from his previous Netflix movie, Army of the Dead. Read more – Leave the World Behind movie review: Julia Roberts’ apocalyptic thriller is more jaded than jaw-dropping It has been suggested — this is purely speculative, of course — that Netflix tried to reverse-engineer a Release the Snyder Cut-type movement for Rebel Moon. The version of the movie that has been presented to us was edited down from a more sprawling director’s cut, which will no doubt be released in some weeks. If this is true, it has to be the most comically inept decision made by a studio since, well, the Snyder Cut movement itself. Almost unbelievably, Rebel Moon might not be the best film about an armed conflict in a mythical kingdom this week. Rebel Moon – Part One: Child of Fire

28,"Tiger zinda hai: In Bengal’s Buxa reserve, big cat’s return brings fresh hope","Two years ago, a fleeting glimpse of a tiger gave way to disappointment in West Bengal’s Buxa National Park, as the big cat was not to be seen again. Then, on December 28, forest officials got an early New Year’s present as one of the camera traps in the national park captured a tiger crossing a dry riverbed. And three days later, on December 31, the tiger was captured at night, on a different camera. The previous sighting, on December 12, 2021, was after 23 years of the big cat going missing from the tiger reserve. Experts are now hopeful that the tiger has returned for good, and what could follow is relocation of villages from inside the core area. Experts say an increase in its prey base, expansion of the grassland, and controlling human interaction are potential reasons for the tiger’s comeback. Buxa Tiger Reserve and National Park covers 760 square kilometers and is located in North Bengal’s Alipurduar district. Its Northern boundary runs along the border with Bhutan. According to the National Tiger Conservation Authority, the Reserve has corridor connectivity across the border with the forests of Bhutan in the North; linkages with the Kochugaon forests and Manas Tiger Reserve in the East; and with the Jaldapara National Park on the West. The first image shows the big cat near a dry rivulet during the day, while the second image is a close-up at night. “It is indeed a positive development. In the recent past, we have been able to reduce human interference, increase grassland as well as the prey base. We have been trying to create an ideal habitat for tigers here,” said Apurba Sen, Field Director of Buxa Tiger Reserve. “It seems to be a different tiger than what was spotted in 2021. However, final confirmation will come after we evaluate the stripe marks. The process is on,” said Sen. According to experts, Buxa is a “low density” reserve and part of a larger tiger territory which stretches all the way to Bhutan. “Over the last year, we introduced 200 chital (spotted deer). In the last three-four years, 900 such deer were introduced (as prey). We have also been able to increase the grassland about 70 hectares per year and create watering holes,” said Sen. Ujjal Ghosh, the additional chief conservator of forest, North Bengal, said their initiatives to curb infiltration and trespassing “also worked towards creating a proper environment. We plan to relocate a couple of villages from the core area soon. That will further work towards lessening the presence of humans”. It was in 2018 that the “Tiger augmentation and monitoring project” was introduced in Buxa by the state forest department, Wildlife Institute of India and the National Tiger Conservation Authority. According to K Ramesh, scientist at the Wildlife Institute of India, who has also worked in Buxa, an increase in the tiger population in Assam’s Manas Tiger Reserve and forests of Bhutan, apart from a proper environment in Buxa, are key reasons behind the tiger spotting. “Tigers always search for new habitat and territory. There is connectivity between Bhutan and Buxa. Once, there was heavy human disturbance in Buxa – from poaching activities to human interaction in the forest – but that has been controlled. I am hopeful that more tigers will venture into Buxa and maybe, in the near future, make it their home. There is also a plan to introduce nine tigers from outside,” he said.

29,‘India needs more affordable trains…’: Viral video shows women entering overcrowded coach through window,"Many have of late shared their experiences of travelling on overcrowded trains, with some even complaining about not getting a seat despite having a confirmed ticket. Now a video is going viral showing a mammoth crowd at the Ujjain Junction railway station. It is not clear when the video was shot, but it shows innumerable people crowding a platform and trying to board a train from the railway track in Madhya Pradesh. With so many passengers crowding the train’s doors, two women get inside a coach through an emergency window, with the help of a few men.

60,"India vs South Africa, Cape Town Test: Lessons from 23-wicket Day – How not to bat in Tests","What’s the best thing to have happened to India on a day when they lost 6 wickets for zero runs? That South Africa batted worse in their first innings to be shot out for 55 and had yielded a 98-run lead on a dramatic day’s play that could prove the difference in the end. South Africa continued their woeful ways in the second, losing three wickets and trailing by 36 runs. The pessimists would identify this run-difference to India’s total from that Pink ball Test during the 2020 Australia tour, but surely India can’t implode again? The day, however, was perfect to rant about the falling standards of Test batting. First, there was Pakistan’s shenanigans on a flat track pre-dawn in Australia before a tailender rescued them. This was followed by South Africa’s implosion in the afternoon before India sealed it by spontaneously combusting in the evening. There was unintentional dark humour too. Soon after the innings’s turning point – KL Rahul getting possessed by a mysterious force to swipe at a Lungi Ngidi short ball to make it 153 for 5 in the first ball of the 34th over – Virat Kohli had got involved in the game. He shepherded the incoming batsman Ravindra Jadeja, while muttering a string of instructions. Jadeja lasted 2 balls, stabbing a Ngidi bouncer to gully. Kohli then went a long way to usher in Jasprit Bumrah, once again he constantly chatted with the newcomer. Bumrah also lasted 2 balls, undone by a kicker that burst off his bat splice. Then Kohli turned his attention to Mohammad Siraj. In four balls, he had spoken to three teammates; no one can say he was alone in the middle and lacked some company. There were no Kohli conversations to be had further as Kagiso Rabada packed him for the fifth time in Tests with a lifter from back of length that induced a hard push and an edge to the slips. Wickets fell like nine pins! 🎳 .@mdsirajofficial & Co. were on the target this morning, snapping up all 10 #SouthAfrica wickets in just the first session of the Test! Watch all the fall of wickets here! Tune-in to #SAvIND 2nd Test
LIVE NOW | Star Sports Network#Cricket pic.twitter.com/viu3OGxCL8 — Star Sports (@StarSportsIndia) January 3, 2024 Until Rahul’s decision, Ngidi had a relatively ordinary day, with Shaun Pollock sighing about his lack of match practice. Everything would change in a Cape Town minute for him, for South Africa, for India, and for the fans. A game-turning triple strike in an over. There was one telling statistic that told the story of the two batting units. Despite numerous shouts and DRS reviews, there was no lbw dismissal in the 23 wickets that fell. It spoke about the bounce on the pitch – the main devil, really – but it also showed how the techniques have withered away. And perhaps some cricketing intelligence as well. Those numbers tell that batsmen could have been leaving the balls on a length, not easy but not improbable but made to seem impossible by the relentless plonking on the front foot without a second plan. There was some irony in their unceasing surprise at the extra bounce that kept ramming into their bat splice. Of the two teams, only one batsman – Tony de Zorzi in the first innings – showed that balls can be left on length. Anything slightly short of good length was flying over, but modern-day cricket has taken away many nuances. Not many leave on lengths, not many have a compact backfoot play, and the results shouldn’t surprise anyone. It was a day for Justin Langer-like leaves off lengths where he would withdraw his bat and watch the ball sail over the middle stump. Or the doggedness of a Steve Waugh or India’s current coach Rahul Dravid, showing the skill and the gumption to stand on their toes and nullify the bounce, taking a few body blows along the way. There weren’t short balls necessarily to be cut or even to pull unless one is Ricky Ponting. It needed dare, skill, gumption, and the ability to adapt – but it wasn’t part of the ticketed fare at the ground in the shadow of a mountain. Two Indian batsmen saved the day, Rohit Sharma and Kohli. Rohit primarily because the bowling at that point, barring Rabada, was erratic but he had the sense of mind and purpose to cash in. The best innings belonged to Kohli who these days blends aggression without boiling over in intensity as he could do. He was relatively relaxed, smiling with Elgar, mimicking a run of a South African on the field, chatting with the umpires. He would cuss himself a couple of times, at scoring opportunities lost as he realised its importance on such a pitch. There was a sequence of shots in the 27th over of the innings against Rabada that captured the essence of his knock. He pounced on a slightly short ball to unfurl a glorious one-legged pull, a shot that he doesn’t play too often. He usually swat-pulls with his bottom-handed wrist taking over but this was as conventional a pull he has unfurled. A couple of balls later, he creamed a gorgeous cover drive right out of the trademark Kohli gif and soon strode forward for an immaculate defense that brought Dravid to mind. It was all soon to change, though as a 43-run partnership in just over 10 overs ended with Rahul’s impulsive decision to counterattack after he had anaesthetised over 30 balls for 8 runs. Perhaps the pulled four in the previous over from Rabada had emboldened him. Maybe. The younger Indians were served a harsh crash course about the physics of the bouncing ball. Yashasvi Jaiswal defended a rising ball and on Indian pitches, it would have fallen near his toes, but here the ball hit the bat harder and rolled back to fall on the stumps. Shubman Gill, whose weight transfer has been an issue in Test cricket, was trying to press back but couldn’t do it in time. He was stuck there in an internet-loss buffering video, but the ball had rammed into his bat splice and swallowed by waiting palms. Shreyas Iyer had already stationed himself behind the crease, close to the stumps – that isn’t the ideal back-foot play of say someone like Michael Slater who would actively go back and across, creating his own length and time to play balls. Here Iyer had nowhere to go, and he hung his bat out. India were shot out for 36 in Adelaide a couple of years ago but that was drastically different. There, barring Kohli, no one chased a ball away from their body. Not one. Their hands didn’t betray them. Neither did their minds; not one threw away his wicket. They were brutally brushed aside by two craftsmen Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood at the peak of their powers, with a little bit of something beyond the mortals on the green. And it was a Pink ball. But this was different. For a long while in the day, South Africa had just one bowler in Rabada, then Burger stepped up, before Ngidi went berserk at the delightful turn of events. Luckily, for India though, South African batsmen were woeful in the morning, and their game didn’t really change much in the evening either as they lost three wickets for not much on the board. Much depended on the man playing his last Test innings, the man who had told his father on the eve of his remarkable match-winning knock in 2022 against the Indians: “If they want to get me out, they would have to break something in my body to drag me out of there, dad. They are not going to get me by hitting me on the body. No way in hell.” He did seem determined to hang on in the paradise on Wednesday evening, but couldn’t hold himself from poking an angler from Mukesh Kumar to Kohli at slips. Most Indians, including Kohli, ran to congratulate him and they would also have sighed in relief. The question now swirling in the air is: how much is too much for India to chase down?",Sports,india vs south africa cape town test lessons wicket day bat test whats best thing happen india day lose wickets zero run south africa bat worse first innings shoot yield run lead dramatic days play could prove difference end south africa continue woeful ways second lose three wickets trail run pessimists would identify rundifference indias total pink ball test australia tour surely india cant implode day however perfect rant fall standards test bat first pakistans shenanigans flat track predawn australia tailender rescue follow south africas implosion afternoon india seal spontaneously combust even unintentional dark humour soon inningss turn point kl rahul get possess mysterious force swipe lungi ngidi short ball make first ball th virat kohli get involve game shepherd incoming batsman ravindra jadeja mutter string instructions jadeja last ball stab ngidi bouncer gully kohli go long way usher jasprit bumrah constantly chat newcomer bumrah also last ball undo kicker burst bat splice kohli turn attention mohammad siraj four ball speak three teammates one say alone middle lack company kohli conversations kagiso rabada pack fifth time test lifter back length induce hard push edge slip wickets fell like nine pin co target morning snap southafrica wickets first session test watch fall wickets tunein savind nd testlive star sport networkcricket pictwittercomviuogxcl star sport january rahuls decision ngidi relatively ordinary day shaun pollock sigh lack match practice everything would change cape town minute south africa india fan gameturning triple strike one tell statistic tell story two bat units despite numerous shout drs review lbw dismissal wickets fell speak bounce pitch main devil really also show techniques wither away perhaps cricket intelligence well number tell batsmen could leave ball length easy improbable make seem impossible relentless plonk front foot without second plan irony unceasing surprise extra bounce keep ram bat splice two team one batsman tony de zorzi first innings show ball leave length anything slightly short good length fly modernday cricket take away many nuances many leave lengths many compact backfoot play result shouldnt surprise anyone day justin langerlike leave lengths would withdraw bat watch ball sail middle stump doggedness steve waugh indias current coach rahul dravid show skill gumption stand toe nullify bounce take body blow along way werent short ball necessarily cut even pull unless one ricky ponting need dare skill gumption ability adapt wasnt part ticket fare grind shadow mountain two indian batsmen save day rohit sharma kohli rohit primarily bowl point bar rabada erratic sense mind purpose cash best innings belong kohli days blend aggression without boil intensity could relatively relax smile elgar mimic run south african field chat umpire would cuss couple time score opportunities lose realise importance pitch sequence shots th innings rabada capture essence knock pounce slightly short ball unfurl glorious onelegged pull shoot doesnt play often usually swatpulls bottomhanded wrist take conventional pull unfurl couple ball later cream gorgeous cover drive right trademark kohli gif soon stride forward immaculate defense bring dravid mind soon change though run partnership overs end rahuls impulsive decision counterattack anaesthetise ball run perhaps pull four previous rabada embolden maybe younger indians serve harsh crash course physics bounce ball yashasvi jaiswal defend rise ball indian pitch would fall near toe ball hit bat harder roll back fall stump shubman gill whose weight transfer issue test cricket try press back couldnt time stick internetloss buffer video ball ram bat splice swallow wait palm shreyas iyer already station behind crease close stump isnt ideal backfoot play say someone like michael slater would actively go back across create length time play ball iyer nowhere go hang bat india shoot adelaide couple years ago drastically different bar kohli one chase ball away body one hand didnt betray neither mind one throw away wicket brutally brush aside two craftsmen pat cummins josh hazlewood peak power little bite something beyond mortals green pink ball different long day south africa one bowler rabada burger step ngidi go berserk delightful turn events luckily india though south african batsmen woeful morning game didnt really change much even either lose three wickets much board much depend man play last test innings man tell father eve remarkable matchwinning knock indians want get would break something body drag dad go get hit body way hell seem determine hang paradise wednesday even couldnt hold poke angler mukesh kumar kohli slip indians include kohli run congratulate would also sigh relief question swirl air much much india chase,2
61,Sports maharajas and their fiefs,"There’s a true story about a Delhi cricket administrator’s single-minded obsession with holding on to power. It is hard to believe for those who haven’t spent enough time in Feroz Shah Kotla’s dark and dingy corridors of intrigue. It so happened that on the eve of a crucial local election, the wife of the incumbent eyeing to retain his influential position at the DDCA complained of stomach ache and had to be admitted to a hospital. Citing an emergency, the doctors planned a minor surgery for the next morning. Mr administrator was in a fix. Those present at the hospital that night recall a sickening conversation between the restless cricket administrator keen to be at Kotla on voting day and the outraged doctor. “He was informed that the operation would need general anaesthesia and his wife would regain consciousness after two hours,” recalls an old Delhi cricket veteran. “His reply blew us away. Without batting an eyelid, he asked the doctor, ‘Any chance you can administer anaesthesia for four hours as that would allow me that much more time at the Kotla as our panel needs to be re-elected?’” By late evening, he was part of the victory celebration at Kotla. Around him were men with garlands around their necks, a bunch drunk on power. Visceral battle cries would hit the Kotla air. While an outsider is sure to get outraged by the mixed-up priorities of the DDCA administrator, in the brotherhood of Indian cricket administrators, an example had been set. At Kotla, they still speak about the supreme sacrifice of one who chose cricket over family. To understand this absurd pull that can drag someone from a spouse’s hospital bed to the stadium, one needs to understand the dog-eat-dog world of administrators where playing the cards correctly could lead to a life of unquestionable power and endless perks. That’s why virtually every sporting body in the country — starting with the BCCI — fights tooth and nail against any clause that restricts the tenure of officials. Recently, former president of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh’s dream of being de facto chief hit a hurdle. After his tenure expired earlier last year, Brij Bhushan’s aide, Sanjay Singh, was elected WFI president. But within days of the selection, the new body was suspended. Brij Bhushan “appears to be in complete control”, was the sports ministry’s reasoning. The life of a seasoned sports administrator, with a serious disregard for rules, can be divided into three phases. It starts with the struggle to get into a federation that is a closed club. This is followed by the tough climb to the hot seat. Winning back-to-back elections, the kind the DDCA official managed when his wife went under the knife, is a sure sign of consolidation of power and the forming of a coterie. That’s the career-high for most administrators, but a handful manage to take that extra step. The true legends, mind you it’s not a virtue, manage to keep controlling a sports body without being part of it. To rule by proxy, one needs to be a seasoned politician. You need to be Brij Bhushan, a five-time BJP MP. He fits the bill to be a ringmaster without being in the ring. The other day at the Indian Olympic Association headquarters, at the end of the wrestling federation elections, Brij Bhushan’s supporters thought that he had swung it. Once it was clear that the odds-on favourite Sanjay Singh had been elected president, the members raised both their hands and let out triumphant shouts. They looked like MLAs outside an Assembly after a show-of-strength head count. In their glee at crossing the last high hurdle of administrative immortality, nuance went out of the window. Now they were openly announcing to the world that their “netaji” — facing sexual harassment charges by top women wrestlers — was back. They had seen it coming. Within minutes, several tackily-designed colour posters with “Dabdaba hai, dabdaba rahega” (our authority will remain) printed on them magically appeared on the scene. Like at Kotla that day, Brij Bhushan was drowned in garlands and surrounded by men drunk on power. However, there was an anti-climax. The government intervened and Sanjay Singh’s panel, with Brij Bhushan’s blessings, lasted barely three days. So does it mean this is well and truly the end of Indian wrestling’s Netaji Era? Unlikely. See the voting pattern of the WFI election to get the answers. The lone wrestler in the fray, Commonwealth Games gold medallist Anita Sheoran, lost by a margin of 40-7 to Brij Bhushan’s man Sanjay Singh. The detailed FIRs, the statement to the magistrate by those alleging sexual harassment by Netaji, didn’t move the 40 members who voted for Brij Bhushan. The members were part of the closed cosy club with Brij Bhushan being the Big Boss. Change could wait, right now Netaji needed them and they obliged. Had there been a change at the top and Anita had become WFI chief, the edifice of Brij Bhushan’s empire would have come tumbling down. It would have been great optics. But how could this all-men’s club allow a woman chief? But what is it about sports bodies that makes a five-time MP like Brij Bhushan cling to his chair? The power to decide the future of the country’s elite wrestlers, to be in the frame with national heroes at their time of glory, the authority to use funds and the lure to have a fiefdom of one’s own are the few obvious benefits that come with the turf. Brij Bhushan’s reign at WFI was a throwback to a time of kings. Sitting on the stadium dias like a maharaja, he would announce special gifts to winners and even snub referees. It was a power trip. So when Brij Bhushan was announcing the tournament schedule and showing V signs to the cameras within hours of his man winning the election, it was obvious that he wasn’t going to walk away from his home — his MP residence and the WFI had the same address. In a year when Olympic medallist Sakshi Malik was dragged through the streets of the capital and ended up hanging up her boots in disgust, 40 voting units chose to trust a politician with sexual harassment charges. For all its traditional facade of values, Indian wrestling remains an insensitive body run by compassionless sports officials — the kind for whom their “dabdaba” is more important than the ailing wife in the operation theatre or long-suffering women wrestlers. sandeep.dwivedi@expressindia.com",Sports,sport maharajas fiefs theres true story delhi cricket administrators singleminded obsession hold power hard believe havent spend enough time feroz shah kotlas dark dingy corridors intrigue happen eve crucial local election wife incumbent eye retain influential position ddca complain stomach ache admit hospital cite emergency doctor plan minor surgery next morning mr administrator fix present hospital night recall sicken conversation restless cricket administrator keen kotla vote day outrage doctor inform operation would need general anaesthesia wife would regain consciousness two hours recall old delhi cricket veteran reply blow us away without bat eyelid ask doctor chance administer anaesthesia four hours would allow much time kotla panel need reelect late even part victory celebration kotla around men garland around neck bunch drink power visceral battle cry would hit kotla air outsider sure get outrage mixedup priorities ddca administrator brotherhood indian cricket administrators example set kotla still speak supreme sacrifice one choose cricket family understand absurd pull drag someone spouses hospital bed stadium one need understand dogeatdog world administrators play card correctly could lead life unquestionable power endless perk thats virtually every sport body country start bcci fight tooth nail clause restrict tenure officials recently former president wrestle federation india wfi brij bhushan sharan singhs dream de facto chief hit hurdle tenure expire earlier last year brij bhushans aide sanjay singh elect wfi president within days selection new body suspend brij bhushan appear complete control sport ministrys reason life season sport administrator serious disregard rule divide three phase start struggle get federation close club follow tough climb hot seat win backtoback elections kind ddca official manage wife go knife sure sign consolidation power form coterie thats careerhigh administrators handful manage take extra step true legends mind virtue manage keep control sport body without part rule proxy one need season politician need brij bhushan fivetime bjp mp fit bill ringmaster without ring day indian olympic association headquarter end wrestle federation elections brij bhushans supporters think swing clear oddson favourite sanjay singh elect president members raise hand let triumphant shout look like mlas outside assembly showofstrength head count glee cross last high hurdle administrative immortality nuance go window openly announce world netaji face sexual harassment charge top women wrestlers back see come within minutes several tackilydesigned colour posters dabdaba hai dabdaba rahega authority remain print magically appear scene like kotla day brij bhushan drown garland surround men drink power however anticlimax government intervene sanjay singhs panel brij bhushans bless last barely three days mean well truly end indian wrestle netaji era unlikely see vote pattern wfi election get answer lone wrestler fray commonwealth game gold medallist anita sheoran lose margin brij bhushans man sanjay singh detail firs statement magistrate allege sexual harassment netaji didnt move members vote brij bhushan members part close cosy club brij bhushan big boss change could wait right netaji need oblige change top anita become wfi chief edifice brij bhushans empire would come tumble would great optics could allmens club allow woman chief sport body make fivetime mp like brij bhushan cling chair power decide future countrys elite wrestlers frame national heroes time glory authority use fund lure fiefdom ones obvious benefit come turf brij bhushans reign wfi throwback time kings sit stadium dias like maharaja would announce special gift winners even snub referee power trip brij bhushan announce tournament schedule show v sign cameras within hours man win election obvious wasnt go walk away home mp residence wfi address year olympic medallist sakshi malik drag streets capital end hang boot disgust vote units choose trust politician sexual harassment charge traditional facade value indian wrestle remain insensitive body run compassionless sport officials kind dabdaba important ail wife operation theatre longsuffering women wrestlers sandeepdwivedicom,2
62,Simple and cerebral: How Mohammad Siraj took 6 for 15 to bowl out South Africa for 55,"“Remember how we batted against Australia and England,” Rohit Sharma would remind in the immediate aftermath of the bruising at Centurion. He didn’t place the bowling in that memory frame then – they too had leaked over 400 runs on a bowler-friendly surface – but they certainly reminded everyone, least of all the South African batsmen, what venom they are capable of. In particular, their top 2 – Mohammad Siraj and Jasprit Bumrah, who pitched in new-ball spells that would stay in the mind for long as they wiped out South Africa for 55 in the first innings. In the time to come, a highlights package might show a couple of spectacular kickers, but it was the underlying plan – refreshingly simple and yet very cerebral – that should be cherished after the profligacy in Centurion. It had the remnants of India’s 2021 triumph in Australia but with an attacking twist: attack the leg-side game of the two most successful left-handers in the previous Test, and keep it simple to the right-handers. Against Australia, it was initially to test out the batsmen’s strengths and patience (like Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne’s), keeping them tied with a packed on-side field. Here, they gunned for the left-handers Dean Elgar and Tony de Zorzi with a more attacking approach to pursue a dismissal. That open-chested predator Siraj had a leg-slip, a deepish short-leg very square (Rohit Sharma had stationed himself there, an oddity from a captain) and kept peppering Elgar on the middle and leg line, testing his balance. Jasprit Bumrah, who had generally kept angling it away from left-handers at Centurion, bowled a series of inward-curlers, even bending in the yorkers at Elgar and Zorzi. The legslip was omnipresent, there didn’t seem anything untenanted on that side. The off-side though was almost barren. Elgar’s father Richard tells a sign that he looks for that tells him how he knows his son is going to have a good batting day. If the leg-side tuck through square-leg comes early in the knock, he is happy. Wickets fell like nine pins! 🎳 .@mdsirajofficial & Co. were on the target this morning, snapping up all 10 #SouthAfrica wickets in just the first session of the Test!

LIVE NOW | Star Sports Network#Cricket pic.twitter.com/viu3OGxCL8 — Star Sports (@StarSportsIndia) January 3, 2024 “It’s a bit strange but somehow that tells me he is focused, his balance is fine, and he is going to be okay,” Richard had told this newspaper. The opportunity came in the fourth ball he faced, the first from Bumrah. But Elgar’s attempted nudge turned into a shovel and the ball ballooned just over midwicket. Was that a sign of what was to come? More curlers came from both seamers, and Elgar would try his best, but couldn’t effect any jail break. The man who had dazzled everyone in the first game with his picture-perfect inside-out cover drives wasn’t getting anything there. But dogged as he is, he seemed to hunch down in the pit, shovelling away. Then came a series of Siraj deliveries on that leg and middle line, and Elgar would do his hop-and-stab or stand-and-tuck. Siraj then threw the bait, a length delivery outside off. In his mind’s eyes, Elgar must have seen acres of empty spaces on the off-side and jumped at it like a real-estate agent. But it wasn’t just temptation but deception too that Siraj had thrown in: this ball straightened a touch and suddenly Elgar was cramped for room. He tried to stab it out, but after being so intent on his pads for a long while, the off-side game wasn’t quite there yet. And unsurprisingly, he dragged it on to his stumps. Siraj meanwhile was working over the dreadlocked Tony de Zorzi. Unlike Aiden Markram, who continued to be a walking wicket unable to pick length early and was playing at everything down the line and to noone’s surprise edged Siraj behind, Zorzi was leaving balls on lengths. Crisp, compact, and secure. Siraj tightened down quickly, started to go for the leg and middle, at his legs. Yet again, the leg slip and leg-side was packed. Eventually, Zorzi went for a nervy glance, constrained no doubt with the leg-side army, and KL Rahul continued his good wicketkeeping job. Bumrah would sort out the debutant right-hander Tristan Stubbs with his pack of tricks, alternating lengths. Then when he saw one of his regular inward-kickers pop off Stubbs’s thigh pad, he would have known that’s the way to go. Another one was GPSed in the same code, and Stubbs stabbed it off the inner edge to Rohit at short-leg. It was 15 for 4 in the 10th over, and India didn’t even have to go yet to Prasidh Krishna or Mukesh Kumar. In his second spell, Siraj would ensure neither Krishna nor Mukesh had to do any heavy lifting. The David Bedingham delivery wouldn’t be easily forgotten by the bowler nor that batsman. It was a kicker from just back of length, and it flew off the splice of the bat to the slip cordon, which was pretty good with Yashasvi Jaiswal lunging either way to pouch catches. With Kohli in ears of the bowlers and also the captain – he could be seen gesticulating to Rohit to have a short leg for Elgar earlier, more good things were around the corner for Siraj. With Kohli urging him to hit the off-stump line to Marco Jansen, Siraj reproduced the request to see Jansen perish behind to bag his five-for, his third such accomplishment. And in his ninth over, he had the wicketkeeper Kyle Verreynne edge a drive to end up with his best Test figures 6 for 15 and South Africa hurried to their end. It was now upto the Indian batsmen to ensure they secure a mighty edge on the game, but that would be easier said than done on this track and against a good South African attack.",Sports,simple cerebral mohammad siraj take bowl south africa remember bat australia england rohit sharma would remind immediate aftermath bruise centurion didnt place bowl memory frame leak run bowlerfriendly surface certainly remind everyone least south african batsmen venom capable particular top mohammad siraj jasprit bumrah pitch newball spell would stay mind long wipe south africa first innings time come highlight package might show couple spectacular kickers underlie plan refreshingly simple yet cerebral cherish profligacy centurion remnants indias triumph australia attack twist attack legside game two successful lefthanders previous test keep simple righthanders australia initially test batsmens strengths patience like steve smith marnus labuschagnes keep tie pack onside field gun lefthanders dean elgar tony de zorzi attack approach pursue dismissal openchested predator siraj legslip deepish shortleg square rohit sharma station oddity captain keep pepper elgar middle leg line test balance jasprit bumrah generally keep angle away lefthanders centurion bowl series inwardcurlers even bend yorkers elgar zorzi legslip omnipresent didnt seem anything untenanted side offside though almost barren elgars father richard tell sign look tell know son go good bat day legside tuck squareleg come early knock happy wickets fell like nine pin co target morning snap southafrica wickets first session test watch fall wickets tunein savind nd testlive star sport networkcricket pictwittercomviuogxcl star sport january bite strange somehow tell focus balance fine go okay richard tell newspaper opportunity come fourth ball face first bumrah elgars attempt nudge turn shovel ball balloon midwicket sign come curlers come seamers elgar would try best couldnt effect jail break man dazzle everyone first game pictureperfect insideout cover drive wasnt get anything dog seem hunch pit shovel away come series siraj deliveries leg middle line elgar would hopandstab standandtuck siraj throw bait length delivery outside mind eye elgar must see acres empty space offside jump like realestate agent wasnt temptation deception siraj throw ball straighten touch suddenly elgar cramp room try stab intent pad long offside game wasnt quite yet unsurprisingly drag stump siraj meanwhile work dreadlocked tony de zorzi unlike aiden markram continue walk wicket unable pick length early play everything line noones surprise edge siraj behind zorzi leave ball lengths crisp compact secure siraj tighten quickly start go leg middle legs yet leg slip legside pack eventually zorzi go nervy glance constrain doubt legside army kl rahul continue good wicketkeeping job bumrah would sort debutant righthander tristan stubbs pack trick alternate lengths saw one regular inwardkickers pop stubbss thigh pad would know thats way go another one gpsed code stubbs stab inner edge rohit shortleg th india didnt even go yet prasidh krishna mukesh kumar second spell siraj would ensure neither krishna mukesh heavy lift david bedingham delivery wouldnt easily forget bowler batsman kicker back length fly splice bat slip cordon pretty good yashasvi jaiswal lunge either way pouch catch kohli ears bowlers also captain could see gesticulate rohit short leg elgar earlier good things around corner siraj kohli urge hit offstump line marco jansen siraj reproduce request see jansen perish behind bag fivefor third accomplishment ninth wicketkeeper kyle verreynne edge drive end best test figure south africa hurry end upto indian batsmen ensure secure mighty edge game would easier say do track good south african attack,2
63,Carnage in Cape Town as India become first team to lose six wickets without scoring in Test cricket,"At 153/4, India looked in a promising position on Day 1 of the Cape Town Test. The bowlers had bundled out South Africa for 55 and with a near hundred run lead, the visitors had Virat Kohli (46) in the middle alongside last game’s centurion, KL Rahul. Which is when the lightning struck. Six wickets off 11 deliveries with not a single run added on the board. For the first time in a single Test innings, a team had lost as many wickets without scoring any run. “If someone went round the corner for a DUMP and has come back, India has been bowled out for 153,” former India captain Ravi Shastri would sum the chaos up on the commentary. It’d start with Lungi Ngidi claiming three wickets in one over, removing Rahul, Ravindra Jadeja and Jasprit Bumrah. In the next over, Kagiso Rabada would claim Kohli and Prasidh Krishna, while Mohammed Siraj was run out. At Stumps, the Indian bowlers had also managed to find three wickets in the second innings for the Proteas, who were able to put up 62 runs on the board. A grand total of 23 wickets in a day, a joint record for all Tests in South Africa. Earlier, Mohammed Siraj would lead the Indian pace pack as he registered his career best bowling figures – 6/15 – while Jasprit Bumrah and Mukesh Kumar nabbed two wickets a piece to restrict the Proteas to a measly total.",Sports,carnage cape town india become first team lose six wickets without score test cricket india look promise position day cape town test bowlers bundle south africa near hundred run lead visitors virat kohli middle alongside last game centurion kl rahul lightning strike six wickets deliveries single run add board first time single test innings team lose many wickets without score run someone go round corner dump come back india bowl former india captain ravi shastri would sum chaos commentary itd start lungi ngidi claim three wickets one remove rahul ravindra jadeja jasprit bumrah next kagiso rabada would claim kohli prasidh krishna mohammed siraj run stump indian bowlers also manage find three wickets second innings proteas able put run board grand total wickets day joint record test south africa earlier mohammed siraj would lead indian pace pack register career best bowl figure jasprit bumrah mukesh kumar nab two wickets piece restrict proteas measly total,2

Anita had the backing of wrestlers, including Sakshi, who had protested demanding the arrest of Brij Bhushan after six women wrestlers had complained about sexual harassment. “We don’t have any issues with the new federation except for one man, Sanjay Singh. We don’t have any issue if the new body comes back without Sanjay Singh. We do not have any issue with the ad-hoc committee as well,” Sakshi told reporters. Brij Bhushan was found liable for prosecution for sexual harassment, molestation and stalking of women wrestlers in the chargesheet of Delhi Police. Sanjay Singh’s first decision as newly-elected WFI president was to announce that the Under-15 and Under-20 nationals will take place in Nandini Nagar, Gonda, the pocket burrough of the former chief. The sports ministry suspended the WFI and an ad-hoc committee is running the day-to-day affairs of the WFI. “The government is like parents for us and I would request them to make wrestling safe for the upcoming wrestlers. You have seen how Sanjay Singh has been behaving. Sanjay Singh should not be allowed to interfere in the federation,” she added. Sakshi said that if the sports ministry can ensure that Sanjay Singh is not part of the WFI, then there won’t be abuse of power. “I can only make a request. If the ministry says he won’t come back it will be better. Everybody saw the kind of power abuse by Brij Bhushan after the WFI elections. He announced junior nationals at his home without consulting others.” Sakshi also requested the ad-hoc panel to conduct age group nationals at the earliest. “I don’t want any young wrestler to suffer because of us. The ad-hoc committee has already announced senior nationals and I request the ad-hoc committee to announce the Under-15, Under-17 and Under-20 nationals.” Family being threatened Sakshi also said that her mother had received threatening calls from people connected to Brij Bhushan. “For the past two-three days, Brij Bhushan’s goons have become active. My mother is getting threats via phone calls. People are calling and saying that a case will be registered against someone in my family.” She also requested those using social media to abuse her and other wrestlers, who were part of the protest not to do so. “People on social media are abusing us but they should remember that they have sisters and daughters at their home.” Asked if she would consider becoming an officer bearer of the WFI, Sakshi said: “”I am disturbed. We just want that junior wrestlers to not suffer. As of now I don’t have it in my mind. We are being blamed for junior wrestlers’ loss and that’s incorrect. U15, U20 c’ships The ad-hoc panel, managing wrestling affairs in the country, on Wednesday announced the organisation of the Under-15 and Under-20 National championships within six weeks, hours after junior wrestlers held a protest at Jantar Mantar and demanded dissolution of the IOA-constituted committee. The panel “acknowledged the concerns” of the young wrestlers who have been hit hard by the year-long protests by top India grapplers. Neither the National camps nor the junior nationals have been held since January 2023. Hundreds of junior wrestlers lost one full year due to the stalemate. Bhupender Singh Bajwa, chairman of the three-member panel, assured the junior wrestlers that he would soon organise the sub junior and junior Nationals in Gwalior. Hundreds of junior wrestlers assembled at Jantar Mantar for a symbolic three-hour protest against the loss of one crucial year of their careers, a situation for which they blamed top grapplers Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik and Vinesh Phogat, who had protested against WFI president Brij Bhushan.

65,"WFI controversy: Junior wrestlers protest in Delhi, blaming Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik for halting their careers","Holding up banners reading ‘UWW, save our wrestling from these 3 wrestlers,’ young wrestlers from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Himachal Pradesh voiced their grievances at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi on Wednesday. They chanted slogans against Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik, and Vinesh Phogat, whom they alleged were hindering their wrestling careers. The junior wrestlers claimed that protests held last year, over accusations of sexual harassment against Ex WFI president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh have led to the loss of a crucial year in their sporting journeys. The tumult in the wrestling fraternity stemmed from the suspension of the newly-elected wrestling body by the ministry, citing alleged improprieties linked to Brij Bhushan’s associate, Sanjay Singh. Amidst the turmoil, the Ministry of Sports has established an ad-hoc panel on December 27 to stir the sport. Since January 2023, the wrestling landscape has been mired in a standstill, with national camps and competitions put on indefinite hold due to the WFI’s dual suspensions, the protestors claimed. Lakshmi from Mathura who has been practising the sport for the last 5 years said, “Senior wrestlers should support and foster promotion of the sport, instead they are discouraging it…No championships have taken place since last one year, do they expect us to reach the Olympics without participating in championships?” “Wrestling has come to a halt since the protests last year. I was set to compete at the under-15 nationals, and many of us had diligently prepared for it. Why are they denying young wrestlers the opportunity?” asked 15-year-old Anushka Pandit, who joined the protest from Dadri, Uttar Pradesh. The ad-hoc panel, managing wrestling affairs in the country, on Wednesday announced organisation of U15 and U20 National championships within six weeks, hours after junior wrestlers held a protest. “We had aspirations of competing at the world championships, but how can we represent our country without the exposure of national championships? What’s the point of our preparation if these tournaments don’t happen? Senior wrestlers have completed their careers and aren’t considering ours,” Joni Dalal from Mandothi, Haryana said. Ravinder Kumar, a women’s wrestling coach, said, “To secure the future of these kids, we urge the removal of the ad-hoc committee and the reinstatement of WFI in charge. District, state, national tournaments – none are running smoothly since the WFI lost its autonomy.” Elsewhere on Wednesday,  Sakshi Malik said that she has no issues with the newly-elected Wrestling Federation of India if Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh-loyalist Sanjay Singh is kept away from the body. Sakshi also requested the ad-hoc panel to conduct age group nationals at the earliest, saying that she doesn’t want any young wrestler suffer. Monu, a coach at the Arya Samaj Akhara in Chhaprauli, Baghpat said, “These kids keep asking us when the championships would take place but we do not have a response to offer, many of these kids are extremely talented and deserve platforms where their talent can be displayed.” Notably, around 300 participants hailed from the Arya Samaj Akhara in Chhaprauli, Baghpat, while many others had also joined from the Virender Wrestling Academy in Narela.

66,"Nozomi Okuhara’s nightmare in India: Long wait at airport, fleeced by cabbie, 4-hour-long wait time in hotel lobby","Former World champion and Olympic medallist, Japan’s Nozomi Okuhara has narrated her allegedly nightmarish experience when she arrived in India for the Odisha Open badminton Super 100, including an anxious time during the stopover in Delhi and trouble checking into a hotel in Cuttack. This follows certain ‘problems’ foreign players posted about, at tournaments in Lucknow and Guwahati the last two weeks. Okuhara, a former World No.1, posted about the problems she had in hailing a cab at Delhi airport and having to wait for more than four hours to check into a Cuttack hotel, on fansnet.jp. “The full story of harsh travel in India. I was prepared for it, but due to a series of problems, it was a physically and mentally demanding journey. I think I can survive somehow with the help of (PV) Sindhu and (HS) Prannoy! Well, it was the worst itinerary ever,” the post read. The Badminton Association of India has been contacted for comment and a response awaited. Having a stranger forcibly try to put her bags on a luggage trolley at Delhi airport without her permission, Okuhara wrote next of being allegedly fleeced by a private taxi for 10 times the usual Uber fare. Made to wait in a hotel lobby for four hours till her bookings could be sorted out in Cuttack, and having to seek help from Sindhu and Prannoy because there was no shuttle bus for her 8 am practice session completed her two-day ordeal. Okuhara had won the Super 300 in Lucknow, and was back in India after a week to play the Odisha Super 100, as she pursues a comeback and chases ranking points for Olympic qualification. The Japanese travelled via Hong Kong to Delhi. She was to arrive in Delhi, stay at a hotel near the airport for one night, and then travel to Odisha, the venue for the event, the next day. The Delhi hotel was a 10-minute drive from the airport, and she was instructed to take a taxi. Her post (translated from Japanese) read: “I have bad memories at Indian airports in the past. When I got out of the airport, a stranger started putting my luggage onto the cart without permission. I got scared and stopped, but he said something along the lines of ‘I’ll take it to the entrance.’ Feeling uneasy, I continued to the entrance.” Okuhara would book an Uber, but it never reached her. “During that time, a number of suspicious-looking taxi people approached me, but I kept ignoring them, thinking, ‘Absolutely not.’ However, I wanted to know where Uber was displayed, so I talked to a guy who seemed a little kind. He said, ‘Uber is not allowed inside, so you have to go outside.’ It was late at night and I had baggage. I was discussing with (sparring coach) Mr. Beppu, and the guy asked me, ‘How far are you going? You can take a taxi,’ he suggested.” The cabbie had agreed to accept a credit card when she asked, but no machine was in sight, Okuhara said. The amount agreed upon was INR 1,344 (2400 yen), allegedly six times the Uber fare. She was told she had to pay an additional toll that would be INR 1,890 in all. She received a ‘toll receipt’. “I had no choice but to pay.” She said she eventually shelled out 4,000 yen, which was 10 times the Uber fare. “Ah, I thought I had been fooled completely, but I was able to arrive safely at the hotel with my luggage, so I’m glad,” Okuhara wrote. She was in for more trouble when she landed in Cuttack. “Although we had requested to arrange transportation from the airport to the hotel, there has been no contact from the Indian side.” Upon reaching the hotel she was asked to head to, she had to wait in the lobby for four hours as no rooms were available. Frantic calls would be made. “Then, a person from the Indian Association came out from inside the hotel and said, ‘Nozomi, I’d like to take a photo’.” She was too flabbergasted for a selfie. “’Wait a minute. We’re not alright right now, and we haven’t made a reservation and there’s no hotel to stay at. Can you do something about it?’ I asked for help.” Sindhu, whom she had contacted, would volunteer to find her another hotel. By then, the Japanese federation would link up with the Badminton Association of India, and would find Okuhara and her coach rooms at a hotel where the Indonesians were put up, reaching there after 30 minutes. “Even though I was occupying the sofa in the lobby for four hours at that first hotel, I was really helped by the kindness of the hotel staff who even gave me water at the end without saying a word,” she wrote. Okuhara would book the practice courts for the next day at 8 am, coordinating with the local organisers. “However, I was told that the first shuttle bus would arrive at 9 o’clock, so I asked for one at 7 o’clock, but there was no reply.” Okuhara said Prannoy and Sindhu would help convince the hotel staff to allot her a car for the remainder of the week. “I’m relieved that I’ve managed to get to the point where I can play, and I’m planning to rest my tiredness a little bit today and tomorrow. India has a wide range, from random people to kind people, so even if you don’t want to doubt someone, you may end up doubting them, or you may feel like you’re being rude and a not-so-nice person. Even in such a situation, I am truly grateful to the manager and JTB who supported me until the end, the hotel staff and tournament staff who were kind to me, and Prannoy who contacted Sindhu this morning and confirmed the hotel transport,” the post read. India’s organisational woes over the last three weeks across three cities have been highlighted by various international shuttlers. * On December 7, Malaysian Soong Joo Ven posted a video on X, of muddy brown water coming from a basin faucet at his hotel in Guwahati for the Masters Super 100. “Imagine showering and brushing your teeth with this water here in India!!!” he tweeted. * At the start of the Lucknow tournament on December 1, Soong faced hassles reaching the stadium and had to jump over highway dividers to reach an alternate car on the other side of the road. “From what was supposed to be a 20-min ride to the venue, it turned into being stuck in traffic for more than an hour because the official driver decided to take a totally different route compared to what we used the past few days. In the end, the LO (local organiser) had to come get me out of traffic and we had to run to another route by crossing big roads and crossing over highway dividers just to get into another car, braving some dangerous driving too. Ended up being extremely nauseous after that insane journey + mad driving.” * Two days before the start of the Syed Modi International, Jessica Tan of Singapore posted pictures of bird poop on the playing courts in Lucknow. She wrote: “Super interesting court test. There were birds flying in the hall and bird droppings all over the court.”",Sports,nozomi okuharas nightmare india long wait airport fleece cabbie hourlong wait time hotel lobby former world champion olympic medallist japan nozomi okuhara narrate allegedly nightmarish experience arrive india odisha open badminton super include anxious time stopover delhi trouble check hotel cuttack follow certain problems foreign players post tournaments lucknow guwahati last two weeks okuhara former world post problems hail cab delhi airport wait four hours check cuttack hotel fansnetjp full story harsh travel india prepare due series problems physically mentally demand journey think survive somehow help pv sindhu hs prannoy well worst itinerary ever post read badminton association india contact comment response await stranger forcibly try put bag luggage trolley delhi airport without permission okuhara write next allegedly fleece private taxi time usual uber fare make wait hotel lobby four hours till book could sort cuttack seek help sindhu prannoy shuttle bus practice session complete twoday ordeal okuhara super lucknow back india week play odisha super pursue comeback chase rank point olympic qualification japanese travel via hong kong delhi arrive delhi stay hotel near airport one night travel odisha venue event next day delhi hotel minute drive airport instruct take taxi post translate japanese read bad memories indian airports past get airport stranger start put luggage onto cart without permission get scar stop say something along line ill take entrance feel uneasy continue entrance okuhara would book uber never reach time number suspiciouslooking taxi people approach keep ignore think absolutely however want know uber display talk guy seem little kind say uber allow inside go outside late night baggage discuss spar coach mr beppu guy ask far go take taxi suggest cabbie agree accept credit card ask machine sight okuhara say amount agree upon inr yen allegedly six time uber fare tell pay additional toll would inr receive toll receipt choice pay say eventually shell yen time uber fare ah think fool completely able arrive safely hotel luggage im glad okuhara write trouble land cuttack although request arrange transportation airport hotel contact indian side upon reach hotel ask head wait lobby four hours room available frantic call would make person indian association come inside hotel say nozomi id like take photo flabbergast selfie wait minute alright right havent make reservation theres hotel stay something ask help sindhu contact would volunteer find another hotel japanese federation would link badminton association india would find okuhara coach room hotel indonesians put reach minutes even though occupy sofa lobby four hours first hotel really help kindness hotel staff even give water end without say word write okuhara would book practice court next day coordinate local organisers however tell first shuttle bus would arrive oclock ask one oclock reply okuhara say prannoy sindhu would help convince hotel staff allot car remainder week im relieve ive manage get point play im plan rest tiredness little bite today tomorrow india wide range random people kind people even dont want doubt someone may end doubt may feel like youre rude notsonice person even situation truly grateful manager jtb support end hotel staff tournament staff kind prannoy contact sindhu morning confirm hotel transport post read indias organisational woes last three weeks across three cities highlight various international shuttlers december malaysian soong joo ven post video x muddy brown water come basin faucet hotel guwahati master super imagine shower brush teeth water india tweet start lucknow tournament december soong face hassle reach stadium jump highway dividers reach alternate car side road suppose min ride venue turn stick traffic hour official driver decide take totally different route compare use past days end lo local organiser come get traffic run another route cross big roads cross highway dividers get another car brave dangerous drive end extremely nauseous insane journey mad drive two days start syed modi international jessica tan singapore post picture bird poop play court lucknow write super interest court test bird fly hall bird droppings court,2
67,Why is Arshdeep Singh judged so harshly?,"Just 16 months into his international career, Arshdeep Singh has weathered numerous storms. He has been brutally criticized for his tendency to bleed runs—12 times in 40 games has he leaked 10 or more an over in a game; his overstepping woes were packaged as traffic rule memes; a dropped catch off Pakistan batsman Asif Ali in a tense encounter in the 2022 Asia Cup spun vicious and sustained trolling. He did not sleep the night he spilled the catch that turned out to be game-defining, but every time he has been ridiculed or mocked, he has demonstrated an incredible gift to fight back, to survive and prosper.  In his span he had experienced enough of the fickle love of supporters that he once penned a poignantly philosophical poem in  Punjabi, roughly translated as: “For some, I’m lucky, for some, it’s just a fluke. All they ignore is my hard work. All they talk about is fate and destiny. When time is good, anyone can succeed, but the character is tested when one overcomes tough times. Courageous individuals will not back down easily. And a character like me won’t lose hope in tough times.” In his career, he has embodied these traits. For, every time he has been plundered for runs, or looked rusty, or blundered, he has found the wherewithal to fight back and deliver a match-winning performance. Weeks after the Dubai faux pas, he landed lusty blows to Pakistan at the MCG in the World T20 in 2022. There are other examples—in the first T20 game against New Zealand earlier this year, his last over cost 27 runs, and India ended up losing the game by 21 runs. But in the next game, his last two overs yielded only seven runs.  Even in his last game for India, against Australia in Bangalore, he bled 37 runs in his first three overs, but in the last, with Indian defending 10 runs, he jettisoned the dangerous Matthew Wade and gave away just three runs to sew the game. He would not have even played the game—he was dropped for the fourth fixture after listless outings in the previous three games—had not Deepak Chahar flown out due to a family issue.  But these lucky breaks compensate for the thankless nature of his job. Unlike most of India’s first-choice seamers, he is limited to T20Is. The 50-over trial stopped with three games. The one-format confinement is a bane as he does not have an alternative avenue, other than the frailer world of IPL and unwatched realm of domestic cricket, for redemption. He is always walking a tight-rope, swaying to this side and that but somehow not falling off the slender thread. Whereas the likes of Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj and Mohammed Shami have the platform of Tests and ODIs, where they could easily atone for the bad days in T20s. Arshdeep is judged solely by his T20 games, and measured indiscriminately by the numbers—the number of wickets and runs. In T20s, there is nothing like the “unlucky spells” of Test cricket. Play and misses don’t count; neither does the top-edged six or the under-edged four. The evaluation of new-ball or death over specialists seems to be through the eternal fault-finding eyes of a cynic—if you have bargained a few wickets, you are blasted for not containing runs. If you have been thrifty, you are nit-picked for not plucking wickets. Especially, if you do not have the aura of a celebrity cricketer.  The metrics are harder for someone who primarily bowls at the death and takes the new ball. Both times, the batsmen are inclined to chaos. The ball barely moves around at the start. When the conditions aligned  once in Thiruvananthapuram, against South Africa, he produced an incisive  new-ball spell, moving the ball both ways and threatening a wicket every ball. The ball rarely reverses at the death. The fence is often pushed inside; the pitches are often batting beauties catering to the gluttonous eyes of the audience. And Arshdeep does not have the eye-catching craft of Bumrah or Shami. He is not as quick as either, does not seam or seam, or possess cryptic variation. But what he has is the wicked angle of a left-arm seamer, the devil to shape the ball a shade inside to the right-hander as well as hold the line. At the death, he possesses a stump-blasting yorker (though its precision has tapered off in the last few games) and a nostril-sniffing short-ball (which remains sharp). He has developed cutters and slower balls too, though the overuse of it has made him easier to line-up.  All these skills, searing into the batsmen from unusual angles, explain why left-arm seamers are considered more equal than their right-arm colleagues, the basis they get a longer run than right-handers. A raft of seamers—from Umran Malik and Avesh Khan to Shivam Mavi  and Mukesh Kumar—were tried around the same time as Arshdeep, but none perhaps got as deep a run to prove himself as the southpaw. And in a breeze, he sits fourth among India’s most prolific seamers in this format (58 wickets). On his wicket-taking skill hinges his potential longevity.  Yet, his spot in the side has never looked fully certain; yet, he has never been talked up as a permanent fixture, a bad spell away from being shamed, a dropped catch away from being trolled, or a bad day away from being forgotten. Even this South Africa tour is projected as some kind of last-chance saloon for him. But Arshdeep, in his short career, has travelled through the whole spectrum of emotions, and emerged stronger from crisis, often wielding a pen that has been as sharp as his bouncer.  Numbers  6 Arshdeep Singh is India’s sixth highest wicket-taker in T20s ever.  14.25 Among Indian bowlers who have picked more than 10 wickets, he has the second highest strike-rate.

68,How Unai Emery exacted sweet revenge on former employers Arsenal and took Aston Villa to a top-3 spot in Premier League,"After the final whistle that sent Villa Park into raptures, Unai Emery didn’t linger too long on the ground to soak in the 1-0 victory over Arsenal, his old employers. A faint but content smile spread over his face, he rushed past a cavalcade of handshakes to the tunnel, where he was spotted hugging former Arsenal wards before vanishing into the bowels of the stadium. If there was a lurking sense of revenge, the Spaniard did creditably to conceal the feeling. He later denied that his past with Arsenal had any bearing on how “special he felt about the night”, even though John McGinn, the captain and scorer of the winning goal, had said that “today was a little bit of revenge (for Emery).” Whether the win over Arsenal gave him extra joy or not, it certainly marked another giant stride towards Emery’s Premier League retribution, besides emphasising that Villa are perhaps more than just outsiders. Once ridiculed for everything; from his English accent to red patches on the sleeve of his blazers to his tactics, mocked as a “Europa specialist”, nicknamed Traffic Warden for his sideline gestures; he is exacting sweet revenge on his critics. This is football. 👌 Emery Ball in full flow! 😍 pic.twitter.com/Cy18WxMQFg — Aston Villa (@AVFCOfficial) December 10, 2023 While the season is still young, and hence presumptuous to term Aston Villa title-pushers, unsure about whether they would wither in the pressure or weather the storm, Emery has transformed them from a team fighting for survival to one tussling for at least a top-four spot. When he inherited the club from Steven Gerrard last year, they were 16th, dithering without direction, a club that seemed as clueless as it was spiritless. But in six months, he not only helped them survive, but steered them to seventh spot last season, before lifting them to third after 16 games this edition. Behind the rather dramatic revival — to contextualise his progress, he has won 32 of his first 51 games in charge of Aston Villa, whereas Pep Guardiola managed 30 and Jurgen Klopp 24 — is a constantly evolving manager’s nerdish obsession with the finer details of the game, a conversationalist and motivator who spends considerable time talking with the players, cajoling, convincing and eventually getting the best out of them. Little wonder that most of the players have improved a few notches under him. Striker Ollie Watkins was instructed to run within the width of the penalty box and not drift too much into wide areas beyond the box. The move has unlocked the clinical poacher in him. In 23 games in all competitions this season, he has racked up 13 goals and eight assists. With video analysts in tow, Emery would show him detailed visuals of former strikers he has worked with, like Edinson Cavani at Paris Saint-Germain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang at Arsenal and Carlos Bacca at Sevilla. Watkins would say: “He has changed my mindset. I’m being smart with my runs, Before I was running into the channels and into the corners, and doing a lot of work for the team. Now I’m staying within the width of the box and timing my runs,” he said a couple of weeks ago. THIS TEAM. 😮‍💨 Highlights: Aston Villa 1-0 Arsenal! 👊 pic.twitter.com/V3vBCChxHR — Aston Villa (@AVFCOfficial) December 10, 2023 Similarly, the experienced McGinn, an old-school box-to-box midfielder, was told to take more time on the ball. “He would tell me to have more touches. In Scotland, you’re told to clear it after two or three touches. Every day, I’m learning different things from him,” he would say. Leon Bailey was granted the freedom to dribble and improvise, as he did with telling effect against Manchester City; the tenacious holding midfielder was told to unleash more shots on goal because he has the gift to score with long-rangers. Veteran goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez is being remoulded into a modern-day ball-playing goalkeeper. “His way of doing things is different. He knows exactly what he wants. Day in and day out, he knows what he’s doing to help us get three points,” Bailey would say after the Manchester City game. Having his way Emery has changed the pre-game routines too. Before a game, they would all stay at a hotel near the stadium, they would dine on the same table after long squad meetings where he would first show various tactical videos and then motivational films. To unwind, he engages players in paddle tennis tournaments, besides bonding sessions during breaks and preseasons. Two familiar faces have helped his Premier League redemption journey too — president of football operations Monchi, and Damian Vidagany, a close friend of Emery who juggles with a large spread of roles. He brought six other staff members, who he had known or worked with, thus building a close circle of trust, which he felt he clearly lacked in his time with Arsenal, where he admittedly felt he was an outsider. “Arsenal couldn’t protect me. Truth is, I felt alone,” he told The Guardian, months after he was sacked. He talks about Arsenal with a sense of both warmth and regret. “It’s a club I had invested a lot in,” he once said. He had frame-worked Arsenal’s return path to glory with a reliance on youth. Some of the key figures of Arteta’s Arsenal — Bukayo Saka, Eddie Nketiah, Gabriel Martinelli — took baby steps under him. The ouster, he said, would come as a shock. The snub shattered him, but he picked up the shards of broken self- belief and rebuilt his career, A reasonably successful time at Villarreal before he returned to the Premier League. Underpinning his success is his tactical flexibility. The impression that he tunes his teams to counter-attack — as was the case with his early Sevilla side — still sticks. A special, special night. ✨ Highlights: Aston Villa 1-0 Man City. 🤩 pic.twitter.com/iSREiWpTMN — Aston Villa (@AVFCOfficial) December 7, 2023 Rather, his is an amalgamation of different approaches, marked by incredible tactical flexibility. Against Manchester City, he packed his team with four classical central midfielders to man-mark City’s attackers. It’s a trend that is getting increasingly popular in Italian football, and helps wield midfield control as well as create overloads centrally. City were caught off-guard, and Villa pressed relentlessly higher up the pitch, winning possession in the final third 13 times, the most ever against a Guardiola team. Against Arsenal, they did not always press as high. They are lightning quick in transitions, with McGinn and the two No. 10s Bailey and Moussa Diaby all slicing into spaces with both incision and precision. A robust backline protected by the tenacious double pivot of Douglas Luiz and Boubacar Kamara has made them an impregnable defensive block, as Arsenal and City would vouch for. Both Arteta and Guardiola, whose teams Emery beat in the space of four days, played up Villa’s title-challenging potential. Beyond the theme of redemption and Villa pushing for the title, here is a manager enjoying what he does. It was not the case at Arsenal, where he said there was too much politics behind his back, where he was coaching with a group of strangers, where he had little freedom and most of all, where the giant shadow of Arsene Wenger loomed over him. At Villa, Emery is casting his own shadow.

69,"Geography on its side, but Guwahati’s Badminton academy has uphill  climb matching Hyderabad’s history","Ashmita Chaliha led 10-5 in the opening set against upcoming Thai youngster Lalinrat Chaiwan, 22, and promptly ceded advantage to go a set down at her home event, the Guwahati Masters Super 100. Next set, the 24-year-old Indian led for most part, including at 15-11 to give herself a 18-16 platform from where she could’ve forced a decider. But her challenge fizzled out as she lost 21-17, 22-20 in 38 minutes. The powerful southpaw from Assam has the game, and the attack that ought to have made her a straight successor to PV Sindhu. But though she impresses every time she steps onto the court, the breakthrough is taking a long while, as yet another season draws to a close. Ashmita continues searching for a way to close out matches. While Assam’s Dipankar Bhattacharjee brought the jump smash to Indian shores, Ashmita isn’t the first woman from the state to impress with her leaping kill shot. One of the biggest – and last – hammerings handed out to Saina Nehwal in her junior days in early 2000s, came from Assam’s most audacious and well built shuttlers, Krishna Dekaraja. Nehwal was bagelled in fact. Experienced and trained eyes on the circuit say, Krishna could jump-smash higher than 6 footer male shuttlers at Bangalore. She was poised for a breakout, but the seniors career didn’t take off as the crucial 17-20 years stage petered off, and then an ACL knee injury felled her efforts. Saina meanwhile was guided excellently by the brightest coaching brain from the country, Pullela Gopichand, and bounced back spectacularly from that whitewash, and carved for herself a very successful international career.  The stream of talent from Assam continues with youngster Isharani Baruah from Dibrugarh whipping up one fine storm on courts, and showing pugnacious intent to challenge the bigger names in juniors.  The North East has seen the emergence of Meiraba Maisnam in singles, though consistency eludes him compulsively. And while there is much excitement about the men’s doubles pair, Manjit Singh Khwairakpam and Dingku Singh Konthoujam, also from Manipur, fingers are anxiously crossed about their temperament to finish games as well. Dingku also plays mixed with Priya Konjengbam.  For a set of shuttlers gifted physically with strength and stamina, and no dearth of flair, results that see frittering of leads and running out of steam, are recurring occasions to wonder why badminton isn’t taking off and scaling higher realms in that part of the country. A swanky new academy of the Badminton Association of India with top-notch facilities has come up at Guwahati in the last year. It promises personalised attention, and has plentiful coaches to help those who show the hunger to succeed. Some seriously big names in coaching were announced and should be at hand, once there’s a glimmer of grit shown. The base fitness standards are expected to go up, and fundamentals drilled in. Results will be keenly followed in the next 2-3 years as a bunch of teenagers are assembled there. While it is open to juniors from across the country, it is especially helpful for talent from the north east. Travelling back to the hills in Mizoram and Manipur is an overnight journey away now, while training in Chandigarh, Bangalore and Mumbai would typically take two days by train. Parents from northeast can drop in, in case of homesickness with distances not more than 500-600 kms.  While the north east is hardly homogenous, and recently troubled faultlines throw ethnic tensions and differences into stark relief, proximity to home is a major factor for upcoming shuttlers headed to Guwahati. Experiments to transplant them to Bangalore have been going on for 20 odd years now, but both of India’s premier centres with the coaching expertise and tactical nous, will need to factor in the cultural strangeness of Bangalore and Hyderabad to north easterners and the adjustments demanded off them.  Leaving the comfort zones has proven almighty difficult, and there are further complexities of dealing with teenagers who upon finding freedom in the big city, are historically lost to distractions. There’s a case from a decade ago, of a gifted player from the north east, struggling to wean himself away from video games once in Bangalore, and wasting away some serious talent. It wasn’t even about frequenting arcades, but going to sleep late and turning up groggy for practice the next morning. The onus of making the most of a training stint after travelling so far away from home, falls on teenage minds, as there’s only so much that coaches will push. Disciplining teens who are living miles away from families is a delicate tightrope.  The language poses a problem. And for sturdy individuals used to their fork fill of bamboo-shoot, beef and pork, and a different rice even, the southern metro mess kitchens with just the chicken and lamb and hugely different spicing, can all prove to be way much too different. Levelling up in a sport itself is a high pressure phase for juniors, having to bite into unfamiliar fare thrice a day has seen a few drop it all and head back home. Guwahati offers a convenient alternative. But it will need to prove it can produce players, who can transition to the international circuit and get results, the sorts that Indian badminton is accustomed to, as delivered consistently in Hyderabad. Ashmita who has steadfastly insisted on building herself a career while not leaving home in Guwahati, will be the starting point of the litmus test. While motivation varies from individual to individual, shuttlers from the north east need that one example from amongst them to follow, who shows fiery ambition and puts in the very hard yards of effort that’s needed to excel in this sport.  Hmar Lalthazuala, currently lodged at Guwahati, was scouted out by Pullela Gopichand for not just his height, but also ace talent, a start point of ambition and long limbs. He would hone the youngster’s attitude, guide him through the growth spurt and get him started on winning even in Hyderabad, before he made the move back to Guwahati. How to travel to tournaments, what are match-day routines, how to strategise and how to close out matches are specific skills that need to be hammered in, and are quite different from mere training and fitness work.  Gopichand mastered this drill from scratch for two Olympic and five World Championship medalling athletes, and produced results consistently in elite levels. The Padukone academy has found its own success, though not as prolific as what Hyderabad produced. Still, the two centres boast of the best results for India internationally, and have laid down the marker for Guwahati to follow.  Mizoram, where Gopichand extensively scouted and helped put in place a basic framework to serve as a feeder centre, posed its unique charming challenges. They love their art and music out there, nurse deep community ties, have clean air, healthy food and a cushy family cocoon with faith and culture being important to their upbringing. Education is important to the Mizo community, and it needed psychological counselling to convince them to leave the idyllic hills in pursuit of cut-throat competition.  Community-owned land was pledged for a high altitude station, a bunch of centres came up, 4 courts took shape, coaches were trained and youngsters spent a month in Hyderabad. A self-sustaining model with 41 percent expenses of shuttles, shoes, equipment borne by the community has kicked off. At some point, sports science and physios will need to step up, if fledgling careers are to be shaped. Physiques and enthusiasm vibed too, and badminton took root. Lalthazuala, the brightest of the lot, even won a Youth meet in Lucknow.  Still all this is only the start of any elite career. A fraction of the journey. Smart training, injury prevention, recovery methods and tournament planning all need to kick in. A heavily coached game on-court, badminton still has only one Gopichand and one Vimal Kumar amongst Indians who have delivered elite results. The North East teems with the right body-type for the sport, and has a state-of-the-art academy to boot now. But it is always the human coaching brain that shapes elite careers.  Guwahati offers a comfort zone physically to shuttlers from neighbouring states, but peak performance needs players to step out of the comforting cocoons of their minds. And they should be prepared for the physical effort to be plainly uncomfortable. Ashmita Chaliha will need to shift gears soon if she is to do justice to that wonderful southpaw game of hers. The whole of India, but specifically the North East, is waiting with bated breath.

70,100 missed calls and pleasant surprise: How Kashvee Gautam and Vrinda Dinesh became WPL millionaires,"When pace bowling all-rounder Kashvee Gautam, 20, finished her training in Chandigarh and picked her phone, she saw at least 100 missed calls. Sensing she had been picked up in the Women’s Premier League (WPL) auction, she dialed her father Sudesh who told her that she was bagged by Gujarat Giants for Rs 2 crore — the highest female cricketer who is yet to represent the country has ever got. Kashvee’s earnings are more than that of the present India captain Harmanpreet Kaur, who was roped in by Mumbai Indians for Rs 1.80 crore in the first season last year. Senior Indian player Smriti Mandhana, with Rs 3.40 crore, is the WPL’s highest earner. Hard-hitting opener Vrinda Dinesh, 22, too, was at the nets with the Karnataka Under-23 team that was participating in a BCCI age-group tournament in Raipur when Indian and foreign players were going under the hammer for next season’s WPL at Mumbai. It was about an hour after she raked in a Rs 1.3 crore deal with UP Warriorz that she came to know about the biggest payday of her young career. The financial windfall at this year’s mini-auction, which didn’t have top players as they were retained by the five franchises, reflects how the money in women’s cricket now is no longer a top-heavy affair, but is trickling to even uncapped players as professional scouting has kicked in. As is the case with the men’s T20 franchise leagues around the world, fast bowling all-rounders and hard-hitting openers are the most valued in the women’s game. Remember the name – Kashvee Gautam 😃👌 Inspired by the legendary @M_Raj03, she was the joint most expensive player of the #TATAWPLAuction 2024 👌👌 The new @Giant_Cricket entrant is ever-so-excited to play in the #TATAWPL 🤗 pic.twitter.com/3eVHtHCY7R — Women's Premier League (WPL) (@wplt20) December 10, 2023 Chandigarh captain Kashvee is still trying to come to terms with her career’s sudden spike. “I was training. I came back and there were at least 100 missed calls and I don’t know how many messages. I got the feeling that I had been picked but it was only after I called my father (Sudesh Sharma) I got to know about the money I had got,” she says. Unfazed by the price tag, Kashvee is excited to share the dressing room with a legendary Australian all-rounder. “Playing with Tahila McGrath is something I am looking forward to. She is the best all-rounder in the present time and I just want to pick her brain.” Vrinda’s father, Dinesh, says he sensed his daughter was a “bit overwhelmed” by the development. “I am yet to have a proper conversation with her but she sounded a bit overwhelmed. This girl has earned it. We meet only in the evening since she leaves home at 4:45 in the morning every day. We come from a sporting family. My father played hockey and my elder brother played cricket. We are cricket tragics. She was a natural.” As much as they have encouraged their daughters, the fathers of both cricketers are grateful to the respective coaches for identifying and nurturing their talent. Kashvee’s father, Sudesh, says it was coach Nagesh Gupta who helped him and his daughter understand that she wasn’t just a bowler but has the potential to be an all-rounder.
“We got lucky that I met Nagesh sir. We thought she was a bowler. But Nagesh was not satisfied. He wanted her to become an all-rounder. He pushed her, and now she is reaping the rewards,” says Sudesh. Opener Vrinda’s father Dinesh Subbappa, who has played league cricket with the current BCCI president Roger Binny, credits coach Kiran Uppor. “She is very disciplined but credit to the coach Kiran,” says the father. The coaches revealed the turning points from mini-setbacks that were vital in the journeys of the two players. Kashvee’s coach Nagesh pinpoints how a fascination with speed nearly derailed her career. “You know kids these days. She saw a video of a young pacer bowling with a speed machine and suddenly tweaked her action, bowling biomechanics in search of more pace. She lost her strength, which was moving the ball both ways,” Nagesh says. “The good thing was she realised it after one season and returned to her basics. She got her swing back with the ball and started working on her swing with the bat. She bats at No. 5 and 6 for Chandigarh, and, in the past year, has evolved into a good all-rounder.” Kashvee rose to fame after she took 10 wickets in an inning in an Under-19 One-Day Trophy game against Arunachal Pradesh in 2020 and a nine-wicket haul in the next match against Sikkim. “Kashvee is still not a finished product, but she will reach there in a couple of years. She is a natural talent. She was picked for Punjab when she was just 13. Kashvee has a big in-swinger, which is why most of her wickets are either leg before or clean bowled,” says the coach. You saw the bidding war of Vrinda Dinesh 👌👌 It’s time to hear the strategy behind the INR 1.3 Cr pick and the excitement after winning the bid war 😃👌#TATAWPLAuction | @tatacompanies | @upwarriorz pic.twitter.com/HY77kE1hF8 — Women’s Premier League (WPL) (@wplt20) December 9, 2023 Vrinda’s coach Kiran shares how his ward came to know about the jackpot. “The funny thing is she was in the nets and didn’t even know about it for a good hour,” laughs Kiran. He, too, speaks about a lucky break she caught. “The turning point was when she was not picked for the Karnataka state team. Earlier this year again she was not picked for the Emerging Team Cup held in Hong Kong. The Hyderabad seamer S Yashasri got injured and she went there as a replacement. In the final she scored 36 and India A won the match against Bangladesh. She was picked for the A series against England and now (got) the WPL contract,” Kiran says. Both Kashvee and Vrinda have seen their best friends — Amanjot Kaur and Shreyanka Patil — playing for the national team. With their record-breaking earnings, they will inspire the next generation of young girls to take up cricket as a career option.",Sports,miss call pleasant surprise kashvee gautam vrinda dinesh become wpl millionaires pace bowl allrounder kashvee gautam finish train chandigarh pick phone saw least miss call sense pick womens premier league wpl auction dial father sudesh tell bag gujarat giants rs crore highest female cricketer yet represent country ever get kashvees earn present india captain harmanpreet kaur rope mumbai indians rs crore first season last year senior indian player smriti mandhana rs crore wpls highest earner hardhitting opener vrinda dinesh net karnataka team participate bcci agegroup tournament raipur indian foreign players go hammer next season wpl mumbai hour rake rs crore deal warriorz come know biggest payday young career financial windfall years miniauction didnt top players retain five franchise reflect money womens cricket longer topheavy affair trickle even uncapped players professional scout kick case mens franchise league around world fast bowl allrounders hardhitting openers value womens game remember name kashvee gautam inspire legendary raj joint expensive player tatawplauction new cricket entrant eversoexcited play tatawpl pictwittercomevhthcyr womens premier league wpl december chandigarh captain kashvee still try come term career sudden spike train come back least miss call dont know many message get feel pick call father sudesh sharma get know money get say unfazed price tag kashvee excite share dress room legendary australian allrounder play tahila mcgrath something look forward best allrounder present time want pick brain vrindas father dinesh say sense daughter bite overwhelm development yet proper conversation sound bite overwhelm girl earn meet even since leave home morning every day come sport family father play hockey elder brother play cricket cricket tragics natural much encourage daughters father cricketers grateful respective coach identify nurture talent kashvees father sudesh say coach nagesh gupta help daughter understand wasnt bowler potential allrounderwe get lucky meet nagesh sir think bowler nagesh satisfy want become allrounder push reap reward say sudesh opener vrindas father dinesh subbappa play league cricket current bcci president roger binny credit coach kiran uppor discipline credit coach kiran say father coach reveal turn point minisetbacks vital journey two players kashvees coach nagesh pinpoint fascination speed nearly derail career know kid days saw video young pacer bowl speed machine suddenly tweak action bowl biomechanics search pace lose strength move ball ways nagesh say good thing realise one season return basics get swing back ball start work swing bat bat chandigarh past year evolve good allrounder kashvee rise fame take wickets inning oneday trophy game arunachal pradesh ninewicket haul next match sikkim kashvee still finish product reach couple years natural talent pick punjab kashvee big inswinger wickets either leg clean bowl say coach saw bid war vrinda dinesh time hear strategy behind inr cr pick excitement win bid war tatawplauction pictwittercomhykehf womens premier league wpl december vrindas coach kiran share ward come know jackpot funny thing net didnt even know good hour laugh kiran speak lucky break catch turn point pick karnataka state team earlier year pick emerge team cup hold hong kong hyderabad seamer yashasri get injure go replacement final score india match bangladesh pick series england get wpl contract kiran say kashvee vrinda see best friends amanjot kaur shreyanka patil play national team recordbreaking earn inspire next generation young girls take cricket career option,2
71,Sreesanth vs Gautam Gambhir: How it’s impossible to erase Cricket’s F word,"Like many before him, S Sreesanth, this week, was hit hard by the painful realisation that the taint of match-fixing can never be completely wiped out. The harder you try, the brighter the stain glows. It had all started at a nondescript league game for retired cricketers in Surat where, according to Sreesanth, Gambhir called him a “fixer”.  The synopsis of the decade-old backstory reads as follows: Sreesanth gets named in the 2013 IPL spot-fixing case, he is charged for entertaining bookies, BCCI bans him for life, the matter goes to court, Sreesanth gets relief. It’s in this context that Sreesanth thought the worst was over. He was wrong. Sreesanth would do what those gripped by anger do these days. He took to social media. “Are you above the Supreme Court?” – he asked Gambhir. He would also call his former teammate an arrogant and classless individual. Gambhir’s post, around the same time, had a smile and a philosophical short message for attention-seekers. It was another day at one of the many town squares of the digital world. Two men squabbling with a crowd of gawkers cheering their favourite. However, this isn’t about taking sides in a spat between two habitual on-field rabble rousers. This also isn’t a sermon on where the line should be drawn when it comes to sledging. This is about the black mark that gets etched with a branding iron on those caught with their hand in the cookie jar or even the suspects with sticky hands and crumbs on their face. History of taint  In the subcontinent’s long murky history of match-fixing; favourable court verdicts, cricket board pardons, clean chit by inquiry commissions and factually inaccurate biopics does provide an airbrushed reentry into the fold but it can’t ensure a squeaky clean image or stop stray taunts. Far more talented cricketers, with much older cases, have found themselves in Sreesanth-like situations. Close to two decades after his retirement and about 30 years after the watershed Justice Qayyum inquiry in the corruption cases in Pakistan cricket, Wasim Akram gets to hear what Gambhir had apparently told Sreesanth. Just last year at the launch of his memoir, Akram had sounded a bit like Sreesanth. “Around the world, when they talk about the best bowler in the world, my name pops up but in Pakistan, this generation, this social media generation … they say, ‘oh, he is a match fixer’, not knowing what it was. I have passed that stage in my life where I have to worry about people,” he said. It was difficult to say if Akram had sounded disappointed or worried. More recently, another former Pakistan captain Salman Butt faced much more snide remarks. Butt was jailed and banned for his leading role in the infamous 2010 spot-fixing saga. This week he was all set to be main-streamed. Pakistan cricket’s newly appointed chief selector Wahab Riaz, who too had played a bit part in that sordid News of the World expose, extended him a selection consultancy role. As expected, national and international outrage followed. The F word would figure in the headline for Mike Atherton’s column in Sunday Times. “Banish fixer Salman Butt for good – captains should know better”. PCB wilted, Butt was banished. Back in India, another cricketer with a past, Mohammad Azharuddin was busy campaigning for the assembly elections. Since hanging his boots, he has made it to the parliament, been a state cricket administrator, is back on BCCI’s mailing list, endorsed a Bollywood movie that gave him a clean chit but most of his political profiles mention his match-fixing days. Notorious 90s The era in which Azhar played most of his cricket, the 90s, was when the game’s credibility was at its nadir. This wasn’t just the chatter on the circuit. The ICC’s Anti-Corruption Unit chief during that time, Sir Paul Condon, had made a cynical assessment of the game back then. “In the late 1990s, Test and World Cup matches were being routinely fixed. From the late Eighties certainly through to 1999-2000 there were a number of teams involved in fixing, and certainly more than the Indian sub-continent teams were involved,” London’s former Commissioner of the Metropolitan had said. The players of those dubious games in the 90s have aged, many have served bans for wrongdoings. They now sit in commentary boxes. Most have no resemblance to their younger self. They have sharp observations and deep understanding of the game. However, in case they express an unpopular opinion, their social media timelines are flooded with the F word. In nations that are unreasonably invested in cricket, the breach of trust by cricketers, or even a smudge on their credibility, isn’t forgotten or forgiven easily. When police chargesheets unmask the larger than life much-worshipped super heroes and present them to the world as weak-willed compromised puppets controlled by some seedy betting syndicate, even the unbelievable seems believable.  When someone as important as the Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar points to a red towel hanging from Sreesanth’s pants and calls it the signal for the bookies, it’s human to be convinced. It was an unforgettable frame. Such was its power that no court verdicts could uproot the seed of doubt embedded deep in the mind.  So lawyers might have helped Sreesanth regain acceptability but they couldn’t guarantee the respectability of his earlier life. In the court of law, for an accused to be proved guilty, the prosecution needs to eliminate every reasonable doubt in the mind of the judge. Unfortunately, as Sreesanth learnt the hard way, out on the street or a cricket pitch the bar isn’t that high.

72,Arshin Kulkarni justifies early sacrifices by inspiring India to victory over Afghanistan in U19 Asia Cup,"The Kulkarni family is more used to wielding the scalpel and stethoscope. But Atul, a paediatrician from Solapur, wanted his youngest son Arshin to swap the doctor’s kit for a cricket bag. A failed cricketer himself, his biggest dream was to make his son a cricketer. “In my family everyone is a doctor including my daughter. I used to play cricket and even Arshin’s grandfather also played cricket,” he tells The Indian Express. On Friday, the medium-pace bowling all-rounder, made a big step in fulfilling his father’s wish by not only debuting for India’s U-19 team in their fixture against Afghanistan in the Asia Cup but also starring in the game with a crisp 70 and impressive bowling figures of 8-0-29-3. Atul’s joy knew no bounds as his son donned the star show from the ground in Dubai, where most of the crowd comprised parents of cricketers. The dream journey, though, was filled with sacrifices. One day, Arshin’s coaches in Solapur, Salim Khan and Tilak, told Atul that his son was so talented that he had to shift to Pune, some 250km from Solapur, to polish his game and if he was serious about being a professional cricketer. At that time, he was already in the Maharashtra U14 side, apart from being a regular in the district side. He was good at academics too, but they knew their son’s passion for the game and wanted him to chase his dream. Unlike boys of his age, he might not carry a mobile, but used to take a bat wherever he went. #TeamIndia off to a winning start in the #ACCMensU19AsiaCup 🙌🙌 They beat Afghanistan by 7 wickets at the ICC Academy Ground in Dubai 👌👌 Scorecard: https://t.co/4FgkV7W5HW pic.twitter.com/lXrAPruQlM — BCCI (@BCCI) December 8, 2023 That night the doctors’ family sat together to decide Arshin’s future. At the end of it, they decided to move him to Pune, but not on a permanent basis. It was the biggest call the family made. But practical hurdles kept tumbling on. “There was a problem, his school. He was studying in St Joseph School in Solapur. One day I went and met the principal and requested the school to allow Arshin three days’ leave a week so that he can pursue his cricket. We convinced the school that we will help him complete his studies,” Atul says. Academics-cricket juggle The family, thus, rented a house in Pune after Ashrin was selected by the Cadence Academy. On Wednesday afternoon, he would drive down to Pune with our driver and his grandmother. She used to stay with Arshin and take care of her. After Sunday’s match, they used to drive back to Solapur, this continued from Maharashtra U-14 to U-19 days,” his father says. He was a leg-spinner, who can bat before but his coaches in the nets felt that with his body, he can try medium-pace too. So during his under-16 days, he began to bowl medium-pace and became the all-rounder. His grandfather too was a pace bowler, who introduced swing to Arshin by showing how to use the seam of the ball. Glimpses of India-U19 vs Afghanistan-U19 fixture.#ACCMensU19AsiaCup #ACC pic.twitter.com/XKImgtZXIb — AsianCricketCouncil (@ACCMedia1) December 8, 2023 The driving factors though were dedication and punctuality. He was seldom late to the nets; rewards duly piled on. Last year, he was Maharashtra’s leading run-getter in the Vinoo Mankad Trophy. This year, he was picked for the senior Maharashtra team for the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, before being included for the Vinoo Mankad Trophy knockouts, wherein he struck a century in the final. Recently, he sparkled in the Maharashtra Premier League, where he struck a 100 laden with 13 sixes. Pandya pep-talk Before flying to Dubai, Arshin bumped into one of his idols, Hardik Pandya (the other being South Africa all-rounder Jacques Kallis), at the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore. The lanky boy did not miss the chance for a chat with Pandya, who he wants to emulate. A remarkable display of dominance made Team India emerge victorious by 7 wickets with more than 10 overs left. Congratulations, team India!#ACCMensU19AsiaCup #ACC pic.twitter.com/k89gWRWsAs — AsianCricketCouncil (@ACCMedia1) December 8, 2023 He quizzed Pandya on dealing with pressure. Pandya’s answer was simple—“Just think about the team.” This was exactly his priority against Afghanistan. When batting, he resisted the instinct for big shots. He barely played a rash shot and anchored the chase with his unbeaten 70 consuming 105 balls. An impulsive boundary-hitter, he contained himself to just four fours, waiting for loose balls for boundaries, as he steered his team to their first win in the tournament. Atul is ecstatic about his son, but he knows his son has a long way to go. “We saw his 100 in MPL and now this innings too but one advice I always give him is to be grounded. I know he has been selected for India under 19 but it’s just a start and he has to climb long stairs ahead. We are happy but it will be a fresh start the next day,” he concluded.",Sports,arshin kulkarni justify early sacrifice inspire india victory afghanistan u asia cup kulkarni family use wield scalpel stethoscope atul paediatrician solapur want youngest son arshin swap doctor kit cricket bag fail cricketer biggest dream make son cricketer family everyone doctor include daughter use play cricket even arshins grandfather also play cricket tell indian express friday mediumpace bowl allrounder make big step fulfil father wish debut indias u team fixture afghanistan asia cup also star game crisp impressive bowl figure atuls joy know bound son don star show grind dubai crowd comprise parent cricketers dream journey though fill sacrifice one day arshins coach solapur salim khan tilak tell atul son talented shift pune km solapur polish game serious professional cricketer time already maharashtra u side apart regular district side good academics know sons passion game want chase dream unlike boys age might carry mobile use take bat wherever go teamindia win start accmensuasiacup beat afghanistan wickets icc academy grind dubai scorecard pictwittercomlxrapruqlm bcci december night doctor family sit together decide arshins future end decide move pune permanent basis biggest call family make practical hurdle keep tumble problem school study st joseph school solapur one day go meet principal request school allow arshin three days leave week pursue cricket convince school help complete study atul say academicscricket juggle family thus rent house pune ashrin select cadence academy wednesday afternoon would drive pune driver grandmother use stay arshin take care sundays match use drive back solapur continue maharashtra u u days father say legspinner bat coach net felt body try mediumpace days begin bowl mediumpace become allrounder grandfather pace bowler introduce swing arshin show use seam ball glimpse indiau vs afghanistanu fixtureaccmensuasiacup acc pictwittercomxkimgtzxib asiancricketcouncil december drive factor though dedication punctuality seldom late net reward duly pile last year maharashtras lead rungetter vinoo mankad trophy year pick senior maharashtra team syed mushtaq ali trophy include vinoo mankad trophy knockouts wherein strike century final recently sparkle maharashtra premier league strike lade sixes pandya peptalk fly dubai arshin bump one idols hardik pandya south africa allrounder jacques kallis national cricket academy bangalore lanky boy miss chance chat pandya want emulate remarkable display dominance make team india emerge victorious wickets overs leave congratulations team indiaaccmensuasiacup acc pictwittercomkgwrwsas asiancricketcouncil december quiz pandya deal pressure pandyas answer simplejust think team exactly priority afghanistan bat resist instinct big shots barely play rash shoot anchor chase unbeaten consume ball impulsive boundaryhitter contain four fours wait loose ball boundaries steer team first win tournament atul ecstatic son know son long way go saw mpl innings one advice always give ground know select india start climb long stairs ahead happy fresh start next day conclude,2
73,"Test cricket is very important for my career, says Mohammed Siraj after career best bowling against South Africa","Mohammed Siraj steamed in to bowl nine overs in a row in the first session of the Cape Town Test. Leaking only 15 runs, he’d claim six wickets as India managed to bundle South Africa out for 55 on what was a bowlers-dominated Day 1. Speaking to the Indian bowling coach Paras Mhambrey in a new BCCI video, Siraj opened up on what helped him and the other Indian seamers bounce back after conceding 400 plus runs in Centurion last week cut to Wednesday at the Newlands Cricket Ground. “When I was bowling in the beginning, I felt like my end favored the release. Whenever I was putting in an effort, it was becoming manageable for the batters. So I decided to just release the ball. And as we saw, the results were more effective as well,” Siraj told Mhambrey. Wickets fell like nine pins! 🎳 .@mdsirajofficial & Co. were on the target this morning, snapping up all 10 #SouthAfrica wickets in just the first session of the Test!

LIVE NOW | Star Sports Network#Cricket pic.twitter.com/viu3OGxCL8 — Star Sports (@StarSportsIndia) January 3, 2024 Speaking on the conversations after the Boxing Day Test humbling, Siraj added, “Once our innings ended in the last match, we’d given away too many runs. I realised, I’d tried a lot. So far in my Test cricket career, it was the first time that I’d got a maiden in the 24th over. I haven’t seen my videos, but I’d realised what I’d done wrong. It dawned on me pretty quickly. I knew what I had to do in the next game.” It was within the first session that Siraj and Co managed to restrict the Proteas in Cape Town to the lowest total registered by any team in Test cricket. It had come as a surprise for even Siraj. “No, I hadn’t thought this would happen. To be honest, the bowling partnerships are so important in this format. When me and Jassi bhai were bowling, he was unlucky not to get wickets, but his bowling was creating further pressure.” Bumrah would also claim two wickets in the first innings. Whereas for Siraj, it was a second instance of claiming six wickets in his career across all formats. The right-arm quick had been India’s player of the Asia Cup final, where he finished with 6/21 – his best ODI figures – to dismiss Sri Lanka for a paltry 50. “The only similarity between the two spells is six wickets in both games. I’d given some 23 runs then, here I’ve given only 15,” Siraj said before illustrating the importance of the longest format in his career. “Test cricket is very important for my career. I want to play as many games as I can in this format. You need to be consistent throughout long spells. You get to tackle challenges, which is something I enjoy,” he added. At Stumps on Day 1, South Africa were three down for 62 in their second innings, trailing by 36 runs.",Sports,test cricket important career say mohammed siraj career best bowl south africa mohammed siraj steam bowl nine overs row first session cape town test leak run hed claim six wickets india manage bundle south africa bowlersdominated day speak indian bowl coach paras mhambrey new bcci video siraj open help indian seamers bounce back concede plus run centurion last week cut wednesday newlands cricket grind bowl begin felt like end favor release whenever put effort become manageable batter decide release ball saw result effective well siraj tell mhambrey wickets fell like nine pin co target morning snap southafrica wickets first session test watch fall wickets tunein savind nd testlive star sport networkcricket pictwittercomviuogxcl star sport january speak conversations box day test humble siraj add innings end last match wed give away many run realise id try lot far test cricket career first time id get maiden th havent see videos id realise id do wrong dawn pretty quickly know next game within first session siraj co manage restrict proteas cape town lowest total register team test cricket come surprise even siraj hadnt think would happen honest bowl partnerships important format jassi bhai bowl unlucky get wickets bowl create pressure bumrah would also claim two wickets first innings whereas siraj second instance claim six wickets career across format rightarm quick indias player asia cup final finish best odi figure dismiss sri lanka paltry similarity two spell six wickets game id give run ive give siraj say illustrate importance longest format career test cricket important career want play many game format need consistent throughout long spell get tackle challenge something enjoy add stump day south africa three second innings trail run,2
74,"Skills aside, lack of game time a problem as Harmanpreet Kaur and Co search for ODI answers","While the two Test match wins brought a certain sense of joy to the Indian women’s cricket team, concerns remain in the formats that truly matter. Red-ball cricket remains rare in the women’s game, and while the wins against strong teams were memorable, white-ball cricket is where the context lies. Harmanpreet Kaur and Co have plenty of work to do with two subcontinental World Cups coming up in the next 18 months. The three ODIs against Australia laid bare the concerns that new head coach Amol Muzumdar and Harmanpreet must address. Alyssa Healy-led visitors won two of the three matches by comfortable margins while India were left to rue their missed chances in a three-run defeat in the second ODI. The 3-0 result saw Australia maintain their unbeaten bilateral run against India, with 9 wins out of 9. Fielding follies Throughout the ODI series against Australia, fielding was a common concern surrounding India. It was less than ideal in the series-opener as India struggled to defend 282, their highest total in this format against Aussies. The third ODI too saw India drop a crucial catch of Phoebe Litchfield who went on to score a century. But it was the second ODI where fielding was alarmingly poor as India dropped at least seven catches in a low-scoring affair. It is an age-old problem for India, and one that continues to linger despite captains and managements pointing it out as an area of concern repeatedly. There is certainly an awareness that fielding and fitness have to improve but the proof remains in the pudding. “We’ve not played to our highest potential, especially in the fielding department, I think a lot of work remains to be done. We have been working on it, but it’s not of the standard expected for the Indian women’s team. I can assure you that we will work on it and come back stronger,” Jemimah said after the third match, echoing the thoughts of Harmanpreet. Batting experiments But while fielding remains a concern, India looked well off the pace when it comes to batting in the last two matches. The 282 in the first ODI was a solid team effort, with Jemimah – the most consistent batter among Indians – leading the way despite being ill and fatigued. Promoted to No 3, Richa Ghosh’s 96 was a bright spot in the second match that nearly got India home. It seems Muzumdar is set on trying out the keeper-bat in that position. “Richa is our No.3, we believe that she can be a good top-order player. We believe in her talent and you’ve seen what kind of shots she can play. And if she can use the first 10 overs and then play according to the situation, that is the best spot for her. At least now we feel that Richa at No.3 will be a very good choice,” the coach had said. But the problem with this idea is that in a team of top-heavy batters, Richa has seemed like the natural choice for a finisher for a while now. While Jemimah seems a solid choice for either No.3 or No.5, promoting Richa means India are left with fewer options for the finisher’s role. Deepti Sharma struggled in the second match, and historically, hasn’t set the stage on fire lower down the order when there is scoreboard pressure. And Harmanpreet’s three single-digit scores in the series added more pressure on an already underperforming department. While there is merit in Richa being tried out in the top order India – despite the feeling of having a deep lineup – appear well short in the department.
Add to that, Shafali Verma’s technical issues seem to be catching up to her as she was dropped after the first ODI. Shreyanka emerges a positive Not defending 282 and conceding 338 in two of the three matches is not a good look for the bowling department, but there were some positives here for India. Shreyanka Patil, making her debut in the second match, returned impressive figures in both her outings. Deepti Sharma was sensational with the ball in the second game too when she became the first Indian woman to pick up a five-for against Australia in this format. And Pooja Vastrakar’s early spells deserved better returns, with some help from the fielders. But death bowling is an area to work on as India conceded plenty of runs in the last five overs. “That’s one area where I feel we need to have a look in and improve ourselves going forward, is the death overs, whether it is batting or bowling. We’ll be working hard on that,” Muzumdar noted. Lack of game-time While all three departments need working on evidently, off the field too there are worries. India played a total of five ODIs in 2023, two of those in the last week against Australia. After the third ODI on Tuesday, there are no more 50-over matches on India’s Future Tours Program till December this year. India were supposed to host South Africa and New Zealand in the backend of 2023 but those two series didn’t take place due to their last-minute call to send a team to the Asian Games in Hangzhou. As things stand, these two series haven’t been rescheduled. What that means is that, officially, the Indian players only have the Women’s Premier League on their agenda for high-level competition till the T20 World Cup in Bangladesh later this year. And very few ODIs lined up, 18 months out of the 2025 World Cup they are hosting. Muzumdar spoke about having camps in his first press conference but they can help only so much in the squad’s quest to level up. The lack of competitive international assignments is a serious area of concern that the management and Board must address because only more matches can help the team iron out the many creases.",Sports,skills aside lack game time problem harmanpreet kaur co search odi answer two test match win bring certain sense joy indian womens cricket team concern remain format truly matter redball cricket remain rare womens game win strong team memorable whiteball cricket context lie harmanpreet kaur co plenty work two subcontinental world cup come next months three odis australia lay bare concern new head coach amol muzumdar harmanpreet must address alyssa healyled visitors two three match comfortable margins india leave rue miss chance threerun defeat second odi result saw australia maintain unbeaten bilateral run india win field follies throughout odi series australia field common concern surround india less ideal seriesopener india struggle defend highest total format aussies third odi saw india drop crucial catch phoebe litchfield go score century second odi field alarmingly poor india drop least seven catch lowscoring affair ageold problem india one continue linger despite captain managements point area concern repeatedly certainly awareness field fitness improve proof remain pudding weve play highest potential especially field department think lot work remain do work standard expect indian womens team assure work come back stronger jemimah say third match echo thoughts harmanpreet bat experiment field remain concern india look well pace come bat last two match first odi solid team effort jemimah consistent batter among indians lead way despite ill fatigue promote richa ghoshs bright spot second match nearly get india home seem muzumdar set try keeperbat position richa believe good toporder player believe talent youve see kind shots play use first overs play accord situation best spot least feel richa good choice coach say problem idea team topheavy batter richa seem like natural choice finisher jemimah seem solid choice either promote richa mean india leave fewer options finishers role deepti sharma struggle second match historically hasnt set stage fire lower order scoreboard pressure harmanpreets three singledigit score series add pressure already underperform department merit richa try top order india despite feel deep lineup appear well short departmentadd shafali vermas technical issue seem catch drop first odi shreyanka emerge positive defend concede two three match good look bowl department positives india shreyanka patil make debut second match return impressive figure out deepti sharma sensational ball second game become first indian woman pick fivefor australia format pooja vastrakars early spell deserve better return help fielders death bowl area work india concede plenty run last five overs thats one area feel need look improve go forward death overs whether bat bowl well work hard muzumdar note lack gametime three departments need work evidently field worry india play total five odis two last week australia third odi tuesday match indias future tour program till december year india suppose host south africa new zealand backend two series didnt take place due lastminute call send team asian game hangzhou things stand two series havent reschedule mean officially indian players womens premier league agenda highlevel competition till world cup bangladesh later year odis line months world cup host muzumdar speak camp first press conference help much squads quest level lack competitive international assignments serious area concern management board must address match help team iron many crease,2
75,FIH Hockey Olympic Qualifiers: Blow for India as forward Vandana Katariya ruled out due to cheekbone fracture,"The Indian women’s hockey team received a setback in their quest to qualify for Paris 2024 as star forward Vandana Katariya was ruled out of the squad for FIH Hockey Olympic Qualifiers taking place in Ranchi. With their sights set on a third consecutive Olympic berth, Vandana was expected to play a key role in India’s campaign and was originally named as the vice-captain. But the veteran forward, who became the first Indian woman to earn 300 international caps recently in Ranchi during the Asian Champions Trophy, will be missing in action due to an injury suffered in training, chief coach Janneke Schopman said. “It’s unfortunate that Vandana won’t be part of the tournament. She sustained a fracture in her cheekbone during a training session, and she has been advised to rest. While we will miss the experience of Vandana, Baljeet Kaur who has been doing well for the team will step in for her senior compatriot and Nikki, also a very experienced player for India will shoulder the responsibility of Vice Captain,” said Schopman. On Wednesday, the Indian Women’s Hockey Team arrived in Ranchi, Jharkhand for the Qualifiers. The Indian team led by seasoned goalkeeper Savita will begin their campaign on 13th January 2024 against the United States, a team they fought against in 2019 for a ticket to the Tokyo Olympics. Vandana will be replaced by youngster Baljeet Kaur, while local star Nikki Pradhan has been named as the Vice Captain. Notably, Nikki was the first women’s hockey player from Jharkhand to represent India at the Olympic Games in 2016. Upon arriving in Ranchi, Captain Savita said, “We are excited to be back in Ranchi for the all-important FIH Hockey Olympic Qualifiers 2024. Last time we were here for the Women’s Asian Champions Trophy, the home crowd supported us a lot and we thoroughly enjoyed playing here. We are looking forward to starting our campaign and interestingly our first match is against the USA with whom we played the previous Olympic Qualifiers. I am sure it will be an exciting opening match and we look forward to a good start to our campaign.” The Indian side grouped in Pool B will take on New Zealand on 14th January, and play against Italy on 16th January while the knockout matches will be held on 18th and 19th January respectively. The other teams in the fray include Olympic Silver medalists Germany, former Asian Games Champions Japan, Chile and the Czech Republic in Pool A.

76,India vs South Africa 2nd Test: Watch SA’s fall of wickets in 55 all out as Siraj runs through the lineup in an incredible opening session,"It was a dream start to the new year for the Indian Test team in Cape Town, after 2023 ended on a nightmare note with an innings defeat at Centurion. After winning the toss and opting to bat, South Africa were shot out for just 55 in an innings that ended before lunch was taken on the opening day of the second Test on Wednesday. The wrecker in chief was Mohammed Siraj who got on a roll in an incredible opening spell as he claimed his best Test figures, with South Africa’s batters lasting just 23.2 overs. South Africa’s total was its lowest since being readmitted to the test arena in 1991. Siraj took 6-15 in a stunning nine-over burst as the Proteas collapsed before lunch. It was his third five-wicket haul in his 23rd test, and his first against South Africa. His previous best was 5-60 against the West Indies in Port of Spain last year. Jasprit Bumrah also took 2-25 while Mukesh Kumar picked up two wickets without conceding a run in 2.2 overs. Siraj’s 9-over spell read:

Stand-in skipper Dean Elgar, who scored 185 in the first test at Centurion, was bowled for four as Siraj sent back both openers. Tony de Zorzi was caught behind and Bumrah sent back debutant Tristan Stubbs for three, caught at short leg. There was a 19-run partnership for the fifth wicket between David Bedingham and Kyle Verreynne, but it was only a brief respite for the hosts.

77,"WATCH: Virat Kohli hints Mohammed Siraj where to bowl, the pacer follows and claims Marco Jansen to nab 5-fer","South Africa batters came and went as the Indian seamers did a demolition job on Day 1 of the Cape Town Test, removing the hosts for a mere 55 in the first innings. Leading the slaughter was Mohammed Siraj, who produced the third best bowling figures by an Indian bowler in Tests in South Africa, finishing with 6/15 off his nine overs quota as the Proteas fell to the lowest total against India in Test cricket. Amongst his wickets were Aiden Markram, Dean Elgar, Tony de Zorzi, David Bedingham, Paul Verreynne and Marco Jansen. The left-arm South African quick, who’d notched up his best ever Test innings – 84* – in Centurion last week fell victim to a caught behind dismissal off Siraj. One that was hinted to the bowler by Virat Kohli from the first slip. In the lead up to the wicket, the broadcast camera panned to Kohli in the cordon, who could be seen gesturing to Siraj, asking him to take the ball away from the right hander and try to induce an outside edge.

A wicket that helped him complete his five-wicket haul on the day. The spell on Wednesday, all nine overs on a trot, marked Siraj’s best figures in Test cricket.

78,Dean Elgar on decline of Test cricket in South Africa: ‘It’s sad that it’s gone in that direction’,"South Africa’s stand-in skipper Dean Elgar says he is “sad” with the fact that Cricket South Africa (CSA) is sending a third string squad to the New Zealand for the Test matches.  The situation we’ve been put in is not ideal,” Elgar told reporters, on the eve of the second Test against India at Newlands.  “What happens behind the scenes is totally out of our control. It’s out of our hands, the coaches’ hands, the team management’s hands,” said the 36-year-old. “It’s sad that it’s gone in that direction. As players we don’t have control over that, we have to focus on what we can focus on.” Elgar, who will be playing his last Test match for the South Africa says  it is up to cricket’s administrators “to make the right decisions for players and the longevity of Test format.  “It’s up to players to go out and win and show the hunger for this format. As long as I’m around I’m going to be a Test fanatic and I think a lot of our guys are Test fanatics.” Elgar also insisted that it is a good chance for the youngsters to grab this opportunity and cement their place.  “We can fight and promote the format as much as you can but it’s up to the guys who count the beans. “Hopefully there will be a bit of sanity in the decisions for our players going forward,” he said. Elgar, who has been vocal about South Africa playing fewer Test matches criticised Proetas  limited Test schedule. South Africa will play two-match series until the 2026-27 season when they play three matches against both Australia and England. “It would be sad going forward for us just to play with two Test matches in a series, to me it’s not the best way for guys to learn about the format,” he said. CSA on Tuesday has issued a statement on South Africa squad for the New Zealand tour.  “We reassure the fans that CSA has the utmost respect for the Test format as the pinnacle of the game we love,” the CSA said in a statement.  “Once it became apparent that there would be a clash, we made every effort to find another mutually suitable time slot for the two-Test series in consultation with New Zealand Cricket. “Regrettably the constraints imposed by the global cricket calendar rendered this impossible.”",Sports,dean elgar decline test cricket south africa sad go direction south africas standin skipper dean elgar say sad fact cricket south africa csa send third string squad new zealand test match situation weve put ideal elgar tell reporters eve second test india newlands happen behind scenes totally control hand coach hand team managements hand say yearold sad go direction players dont control focus focus elgar play last test match south africa say cricket administrators make right decisions players longevity test format players go win show hunger format long im around im go test fanatic think lot guy test fanatics elgar also insist good chance youngsters grab opportunity cement place fight promote format much guy count bean hopefully bite sanity decisions players go forward say elgar vocal south africa play fewer test match criticise proetas limit test schedule south africa play twomatch series season play three match australia england would sad go forward us play two test match series best way guy learn format say csa tuesday issue statement south africa squad new zealand tour reassure fan csa utmost respect test format pinnacle game love csa say statement become apparent would clash make every effort find another mutually suitable time slot twotest series consultation new zealand cricket regrettably constraints impose global cricket calendar render impossible,2
79,‘Catches win matches’: Shaheen Shah Afridi rues drop chances off his bowling,"Pakistan fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi says the dropped catch of his bowling has cost the team massively in the ongoing Test series against Australia.  “I feel I could have got more wickets. But unfortunately .. take a catch to win the match. Unfortunately ,we missed that opportunity most of the time. It has been a good tour so far. The last Test (MCG) was awesome as a bowling unit and as a team.,” Shaheen told Channel 7 at Lunch on Day 1. Shaheen, who has picked eight wickets in the first two Tests and looked a bit rusty has been rested for the Sydney Test to manage his workload ahead of the hectic schedule. “I played two games, and a lot of overs to be honest. They’re just managing my workload, the medical team and team management decided to take a rest for this (Test),” he said.  The pacer also revealed that he follow fellow left-arm pacers Mitchell Starc and Trent Boult very closely.  “I have always watched Mitchell Starc and Trent Boult. These two guys are legends. Every left-arm fast bowler will watch these two. I have been following them… how they work and how they bowl in the games and how they prepare themselves,” he said.  Shaheen is also captain of the Pakistan T20I side, which he will take charge of in New Zealand in a five-match T20I series that starts five days after the scheduled end of the third Test. “It indeed isb a proud moment for me to represent Pakistan as a captain, It’s a new challenge for me to manage the team and prepare the team for the upcoming T20 World Cup,” he said.",Sports,catch win match shaheen shah afridi rue drop chance bowl pakistan fast bowler shaheen shah afridi say drop catch bowl cost team massively ongoing test series australia feel could get wickets unfortunately take catch win match unfortunately miss opportunity time good tour far last test mcg awesome bowl unit team shaheen tell channel lunch day shaheen pick eight wickets first two test look bite rusty rest sydney test manage workload ahead hectic schedule play two game lot overs honest theyre manage workload medical team team management decide take rest test say pacer also reveal follow fellow leftarm pacers mitchell starc trent boult closely always watch mitchell starc trent boult two guy legends every leftarm fast bowler watch two follow work bowl game prepare say shaheen also captain pakistan ti side take charge new zealand fivematch ti series start five days schedule end third test indeed isb proud moment represent pakistan captain new challenge manage team prepare team upcoming world cup say,2
80,"T20 cricket, who cares? Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis slam Shaheen Shah Afridi’s exclusion from Sydney Test","Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis has made scathing attack on Pakistan’s premier fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi, who has been rested for the third Test match against Australia at Sydney.  Akram blamed Shaheen, the newly-appointed T20 captain of Pakistan, for prioritising T20 cricket over Test.  “Straight after this [Sydney Test] there are five T20s in New Zealand, and Shaheen’s the captain,” Wasim said on Fox Cricket. “But T20 cricket, who cares? I understand, it’s there for entertainment and it’s there for financial gain for cricket boards, for players, but cricketers should know that Test cricket is the ultimate. ” “If we talk about what happened 20 years ago in this Test in Sydney, nobody knows what happened last night in T20.  “That’s the difference. These guys have to understand and learn, if you want to be a great of the game or do you want to be a millionaire. You can become both but with a little more sense,” he added. Waqar Younis, too, echoed Akram’s sentiments and said Shaheen’s absence made him laugh.  “We play for Test match cricket,” Waqar said, talking to Channel 7 on the morning of the first day. “We don’t play for T20s or one-day cricket. And if you’re missing Test match cricket purely because you are being rested, I do not understand. “That’s a real shocker for me because I was expecting him to be a part of this Test match because he looked good in the previous match.  “He started feeling like the old Shaheen Afridi and started to swing the ball and the pace was getting better,” he added. Meanwhile, Shaheen has defended team management’s decision to rest him for third Test.  “I played two games, and a lot of overs to be honest.

81,Simon Katich says unfair to blame David Warner entirely for ‘Sandpaper-gate’ scandal,"Former Australia cricketer Simon Katich says he understands why it is difficult for most of the Australian public to forgive David Warner for his role in the sandpaper-gate scandal but feels it is unfair to blame the opener entirely.  “I think it’s hard to say ‘full respect’ because I think there is always going to be an element of the public that didn’t like what happened, and rightfully so,” Katich told SEN Sportsday NSW. Warner was adjudged to have played the leading role in the scandal and was banned from elite cricket for a year and from leadership positions for life. Steve Smith was also banned for a year and from leadership positions for three years, while opener Cameron Bancroft was given a one-year ban from leadership positions on top of a nine-month playing suspension. “A lot of us couldn’t believe what the Australian team resorted to,” said Katich.  “But I think to blame him entirely for that whole episode is pretty naive.” At the same time Katich is impressed with how Warner has git himself back to playing cricket at such a high level despite receiving so much backlash.  “I think in time, I’ve got no doubt there will be more said about it,” Katich said. “He took the wrap along with Cameron Bancroft and Steve Smith but I think, the public feel there was more to it than just those three. “At the time, I think what he did was he kept his mouth shut after the initial apology and then got on with trying to go back out there and try to play as good as cricket as he possibly could. That wouldn’t have been easy to do. “What’s done is done but for David to be able to get back to where he got to after such an enormous event like it was in Cape Town… it was significant to think that he was able to get back and play good cricket after that event.”",Sports,simon katich say unfair blame david warner entirely sandpapergate scandal former australia cricketer simon katich say understand difficult australian public forgive david warner role sandpapergate scandal feel unfair blame opener entirely think hard say full respect think always go element public didnt like happen rightfully katich tell sen sportsday nsw warner adjudge play lead role scandal ban elite cricket year leadership position life steve smith also ban year leadership position three years opener cameron bancroft give oneyear ban leadership position top ninemonth play suspension lot us couldnt believe australian team resort say katich think blame entirely whole episode pretty naive time katich impress warner git back play cricket high level despite receive much backlash think time ive get doubt say katich say take wrap along cameron bancroft steve smith think public feel three time think keep mouth shut initial apology get try go back try play good cricket possibly could wouldnt easy whats do do david able get back get enormous event like cape town significant think able get back play good cricket event,2
82,India vs Australia Women’s ODI: Phoebe’s Day Out – Litchfield stars with the bat and in the field as Harmanpreet Kaur and Co suffer 190-run defeat,"In her first ODI knock, it was fitting that Phoebe Litchfield batted with Meg Lanning. On her debut in January 2023 against Pakistan, the then-19-year-old left-handed opener scored a match-winning 78* and shared a partnership worth 137 runs with the now-retired legend of the game. After that game, in which she was filling in for Alyssa Healy at the top of the order, Litchfield quipped: “I am happy to run drinks for a long time. I am just happy to be around this group. If there is an opportunity, I’ll take it but I will be pretty happy to see Midge (Healy) back.” Fast forward a year, and as Australia enter a new era under Healy’s leadership, but with the same old aspiration of dominance, Litchfield is front and centre. On Tuesday in Mumbai, she was involved in a 189-run partnership with the current captain as she scored a classy 119 to power her side to a mammoth 338/7. And it was Healy who had the best seat in the house. India managed just 148 in response and Litchfield was sensational in the field too – taking an early contender for catch of the year at cover to dismiss Amanjot Kaur – as the 190-run win completed a 3-0 series sweep for the visitors. “At 20 years of age, what an unbelievable talent we’ve unearthed,” Healy beamed after her side completed a rout at the Wankhede Stadium. “To have two ODI hundreds under her belt already is scary. She’s one for the future no doubt, for me it’s an amazing experience to stand at the other end and watch the next generation. She is also the self-proclaimed best fielder in the team and she proved that today.” That’s a happy dugout for Pheebs 100 😍 #INDvAUS pic.twitter.com/u3wI2I9aLz — Australian Women’s Cricket Team 🏏 (@AusWomenCricket) January 2, 2024 For India, after getting close on Saturday but losing a match they should have probably won, there was very little to write home about. Shreyanka Patil’s spell of 3/57, with back-to-back wickets of Beth Mooney and Tahlia McGrath, was a highlight and the youngster came for praise from her captain after the match. Deepti Sharma picked up her 100th ODI wicket, becoming the first Indian to reach that milestone in both white-ball formats. But the batting was a no-show as an already steep target kept getting out of reach with regular fall of wickets. Phoebe’s classy ton Litchfield finished the day as the Player of the Match and Player of the Series. When her tour to India began last month with the one-off Test, she was run out for a 0-ball 0 in the first over, after a misunderstanding with Mooney. But since then, with every subsequent knock she has played, she’s shown her class. Incidentally, in the second innings of the Test, when she was looking in good touch, she got out playing the reverse sweep. But come the white-ball series, Litchfield brought out that shot frequently to great effect. In the first ODI, she played second fiddle to Ellyse Perry before shifting through the gears and finishing with 78. In the second game, she was dropped three times and rode her luck to finish with a solid 63. But the third ODI was a case study for a young batter who is constantly learning and improving. The approach against spinners, already pretty solid, was much more assured as she went forward and back as the length demanded. While she took her time to get going in the previous matches, Litchfield was striking at nearly a-run-a-ball from the word go. It’s not often that Healy is a spectator for the most part during a lengthy partnership, but Litchfield was consistently out-hitting her senior partner in a fabulous display of wristwork and footwork. Destined for greater things Ever so rarely, young cricketers reach the highest of stages already earmarked for greatness. Even before they face a ball, there is an aura around them, and it could go either way. They either embrace it or let it get to them. So far, Litchfield has shown she is very much in the former category, not just with her skills but with her temperament too. Her first reaction, in fact, after the century on Tuesday was to say, “I have good batters around me.” There is a video of a 16-year-old Litchfield batting in the nets for New South Wales, showing the range of her shots – including the now familiar drive through the offside and reverse sweep – that went viral on social media in 2019. She was still in school then, but anyone who saw that video, knew they were watching someone special. After her debut against Pakistan, she was asked about being in the limelight so soon in her career. “I try not to think too much about it,” she had said. “It probably comes on when I fail a bit more and I look back and go, ‘am I as good as, you know, everyone says I am?’ but I think it’s just down to watching the ball at the end of the day and once I get on the field, it goes away which is nice.” As 2024 begins, few people will have doubts over the talent that Litchfield is, as she showed emphatically that she’s here to stay.",Sports,india vs australia womens odi phoebes day litchfield star bat field harmanpreet kaur co suffer run defeat first odi knock fit phoebe litchfield bat meg lanning debut january pakistan thenyearold lefthanded opener score matchwinning share partnership worth run nowretired legend game game fill alyssa healy top order litchfield quip happy run drink long time happy around group opportunity ill take pretty happy see midge healy back fast forward year australia enter new era healys leadership old aspiration dominance litchfield front centre tuesday mumbai involve run partnership current captain score classy power side mammoth healy best seat house india manage response litchfield sensational field take early contender catch year cover dismiss amanjot kaur run win complete series sweep visitors years age unbelievable talent weve unearth healy beam side complete rout wankhede stadium two odi hundreds belt already scary shes one future doubt amaze experience stand end watch next generation also selfproclaimed best fielder team prove today thats happy dugout pheebs indvaus pictwittercomuwiialz australian womens cricket team january india get close saturday lose match probably little write home shreyanka patils spell backtoback wickets beth mooney tahlia mcgrath highlight youngster come praise captain match deepti sharma pick th odi wicket become first indian reach milestone whiteball format bat noshow already steep target keep get reach regular fall wickets phoebes classy ton litchfield finish day player match player series tour india begin last month oneoff test run ball first misunderstand mooney since every subsequent knock play shes show class incidentally second innings test look good touch get play reverse sweep come whiteball series litchfield bring shoot frequently great effect first odi play second fiddle ellyse perry shift gear finish second game drop three time ride luck finish solid third odi case study young batter constantly learn improve approach spinners already pretty solid much assure go forward back length demand take time get go previous match litchfield strike nearly arunaball word go often healy spectator part lengthy partnership litchfield consistently outhitting senior partner fabulous display wristwork footwork destine greater things ever rarely young cricketers reach highest stag already earmark greatness even face ball aura around could go either way either embrace let get far litchfield show much former category skills temperament first reaction fact century tuesday say good batter around video yearold litchfield bat net new south wales show range shots include familiar drive offside reverse sweep go viral social media still school anyone saw video know watch someone special debut pakistan ask limelight soon career try think much say probably come fail bite look back go good know everyone say think watch ball end day get field go away nice begin people doubt talent litchfield show emphatically shes stay,2
83,Rohit Sharma on CSA opting for SA20 League over New Zealand series: ‘We don’t have these problems…Test cricket is something we all have to protect’,"Indian captain Rohit Sharma shed concern over Cricket South Africa (CSA) fielding an inexperienced team for the three-match Test series against New Zealand starting next month, with their top players prioritizing SA20 League over the longest format. “For me, Test remains ultimate challenge and we would like to see best players playing that format but everyone has own problems to deal with and make sure there is a reason behind it,” Rohit said in the press conference ahead of the second Test against South Africa in Cape Town on Wednesday. “I don’t know what the reason is (for SA not picking senior players) and in Test cricket you want to see best players being available but like I said I don’t know what internal discussions are in CSA but from my perspective, the priority should be given to Test cricket. It’s a challenge that you face everyday,” he added. The visiting skipper was furthermore quizzed by a scribe if he felt the ongoing issue concerned the Indian players given IPL’s stranglehold on cricket’s annual calendar. “I feel we don’t have such problems at this point of time,” Rohit would respond with a smile. When further pressed on the matter with the counter argument that it was the Indian cricket board’s responsibility to help sustain the longest format of the game. “Test Cricket is something that we all have to protect and it’s not just one or two countries’ responsibility but all who are playing, keep it nice and entertaining. “Around the world, you can see some solid Test cricket being played and you have seen results everywhere and competitive cricket being played, so it’s everyone’s duty to ensure it stays nice and healthy and that is what people come to watch. That’s everyone’s responsibility,” Rohit stated. Last week, CSA had come under scanner following the announcement of a 14-member squad for the New Zealand tour starting early February that featured seven uncapped players. All but two of the players in the side that beat India in the Boxing Day test are competing in the SA20 league but David Bedingham and Keegan Petersen will be going to New Zealand. South Africa’s stand-in skipper for the second Test Dean Elgar, who will be retiring following the match in Cape Town, also termed the ongoing situation in South Africa as “not ideal”. “The situation we’ve been put in from a cricketing fraternity perspective isn’t ideal and maybe the team that’s selected to go to New Zealand isn’t ideal for the conversation of how I see Test cricket,” Elgar said. “It must be seen in that light as we can’t control what happens behind the scenes. It is out of the players, coaches and team management’s hands,” he added. Also among those condemning the move was former Australia captain Steve Waugh, who told The Sydney Morning Herald, “Obviously they don’t care. It’s going to happen if the South African Cricket Board are any indication of the future, keeping their best players at home. If I was New Zealand I wouldn’t even play the series. I don’t know why they’re even playing. Why would you when it shows a lack of respect for New Zealand cricket? “It’s pretty obvious what the problem is. The West Indies aren’t sending their full-strength side (to Austalia this summer). They haven’t picked a full-strength Test team for a couple of years now. Someone like Nicholas Pooran is really a Test batsman who doesn’t play Test cricket. Jason Holder, probably their best player, is not playing now. Even Pakistan didn’t send a full side [to Australia]. If the ICC or someone doesn’t step in shortly then Test cricket doesn’t become Test cricket because you’re not testing yourself against the best players,” Waugh added.",Sports,rohit sharma csa opt sa league new zealand series dont problemstest cricket something protect indian captain rohit sharma shed concern cricket south africa csa field inexperienced team threematch test series new zealand start next month top players prioritize sa league longest format test remain ultimate challenge would like see best players play format everyone problems deal make sure reason behind rohit say press conference ahead second test south africa cape town wednesday dont know reason sa pick senior players test cricket want see best players available like say dont know internal discussions csa perspective priority give test cricket challenge face everyday add visit skipper furthermore quiz scribe felt ongoing issue concern indian players give ipls stranglehold cricket annual calendar feel dont problems point time rohit would respond smile press matter counter argument indian cricket board responsibility help sustain longest format game test cricket something protect one two countries responsibility play keep nice entertain around world see solid test cricket play see result everywhere competitive cricket play everyones duty ensure stay nice healthy people come watch thats everyones responsibility rohit state last week csa come scanner follow announcement member squad new zealand tour start early february feature seven uncapped players two players side beat india box day test compete sa league david bedingham keegan petersen go new zealand south africas standin skipper second test dean elgar retire follow match cape town also term ongoing situation south africa ideal situation weve put cricket fraternity perspective isnt ideal maybe team thats select go new zealand isnt ideal conversation see test cricket elgar say must see light cant control happen behind scenes players coach team managements hand add also among condemn move former australia captain steve waugh tell sydney morning herald obviously dont care go happen south african cricket board indication future keep best players home new zealand wouldnt even play series dont know theyre even play would show lack respect new zealand cricket pretty obvious problem west indies arent send fullstrength side austalia summer havent pick fullstrength test team couple years someone like nicholas pooran really test batsman doesnt play test cricket jason holder probably best player play even pakistan didnt send full side australia icc someone doesnt step shortly test cricket doesnt become test cricket youre test best players waugh add,2
84,Rafael Nadal sends positive vibes in comeback match with straight-sets win over Dominic Thiem,"Rafael Nadal put any concern about rustiness to bed following his year-long injury layoff, defeating 2020 US Open champion Dominic Thiem 7-5, 6-1 in routine fashion in the first round of the Brisbane International on Tuesday. Nadal, playing his first singles match since suffering a hip flexor injury in his second-round defeat at last year’s Australian Open, looked razor-sharp from the get-go, typically taking command with his big forehand and dominant play from the baseline. His serve was especially accurate, winning 90 percent of the points on his first serve and two-thirds of them on his serve in total. His movement was sharp, and he also put in plenty of returns back in play. “Today is honestly an emotional and important day for me after probably one of the toughest years of my tennis career,” the Spaniard was quoted as saying by Reuters after the match. “I had the chance to come back after a year and play in front of an amazing crowd and play at a very positive level on the first day is something that makes us feel proud – my team and family who have been there every day in the last year.” Phenome-Nadal 😍@RafaelNadal #BrisbaneTennis pic.twitter.com/6z6U748pFz — Tennis TV (@TennisTV) January 2, 2024 Nadal asserted, later in his press conference, that he was happy to overcome any lingering fears regarding his competitive level with a confidence-boosting win. “For me, the main thing is (to) stay healthy. I really think that I didn’t forget how to play tennis. The only thing that’s going to be difficult (is) to make it in a professional match and at a very high level of tennis,” he said. “You need to recover the confidence and the movements. That takes time. After the surgery, you feel scared sometimes to do a kind of movement and you need to recover the speed and reading the ball and (doing) things in an automatic way.” Another comeback bid Thiem, a former World No.3 himself who is looking to return to his competitive best after spending a few seasons in and around the top 100, turned out to be a valiant sparring partner for Nadal, showing glimpses of his former self in a high-quality first set. Despite leaking too many errors, the Austrian’s power was telling during most of the baseline exchanges, forcing Nadal to elevate his game at the back end of the set to find the breakthrough and convert a fourth break point in the 12th game to take the opening set. The intensity and shot-making on display in that period was reminiscent of some of the best tennis during the duo’s consecutive French Open finals in 2018 and 2019, both of which Nadal won. @RafaelNadal is absolutely amazing! Having not played in more than 350 days after hip surgery, beating @domithiem 7:5 6:1 in the first round in Brisbane — Boris Becker (@TheBorisBecker) January 2, 2024 There was no looking back for him from there, who took the initiative early in the second set, breaking in Thiem’s first service game and consolidating his position further from there. “You need hours on court, hours in a practice session, but at the same time hours in professional matches,” Nadal would later say. “I (didn’t) know what could happen today. It’s a day to be happy. I am excited to have the chance to play another time.” Despite having made several injury comebacks in the past, most recently at the 2022 Australian Open where he returned from surgery to win the title after coming back from a two-set deficit in the final, this is the first time in his career that Nadal has been forced to return to his best after such a long period away from competitive action. With uncertainty regarding the level he will be able to return at, a solid performance and win bodes well for his hopes to script another fairytale in Melbourne, where the Australian Open kicks off on January 14.

85,"IND vs SA, 2nd Test: Will Ashwin and Jadeja play together? Will Mukesh Kumar or Avesh Khan make their debut?","With the Table Mountain in the background, India have an uphill task of mounting a comeback in the second and final Test against South Africa in Cape Town. Having been outplayed across all departments in Centurion, they face plenty of questions with regards to their team combination and balance. Here are the talking points: Batsmen shown faith In both the innings at Centurion, India’s batting unit failed to cope with the bounce and seam movement. In conditions where they were supposed to be compact and tight, they were guilty of failing to do the basics. Given this is a batting unit that is in transition, India will not be seeking reinforcements unless they are forced because of anybody’s unavailability. So in that case, Abhimanyu Easwaran will spend another game warming the bench. So where to expect changes? Definitely on the bowling front. Shardul Thakur, who was hit on the shoulder a couple of days back at a training session, isn’t ruled out of the game. But with Ravindra Jadeja, who missed the first Test with a back spasm, fit and available, India have a few calls to make not just with regards to the make up of the bowling combination, but also the personnel. Is there space for both Ashwin and Jadeja? Despite fielding two spinners in Australia and England, India have not fielded two spinners traditionally in South Africa. When it comes to just one spot in SENA countries, India have been inclined to Jadeja, since he offers something different as a left-hander and is seen more as a batting all-rounder rather than a bowling all-rounder. The southpaw, though, has previously played only one Test in South Africa and has missed the last four with injury. Ashwin, on the other hand, has played seven Tests, but hasn’t been as effective in terms of wickets as in other places. However, Cape Town is seen as a venue where the pitch could get dry and the cracks could open up from Day 3. And unlike Centurion, there isn’t much grass cover. Prasanna Agoram, who is working with the Lions team on South Africa’s domestic circuit, offered this on X: “Dry grass has been watered for a couple of days. Grass will come off and the cracks will open up and spinners will come into play later on. Will be interesting to see what combination India will come up with,” with a photo of the pitch accompanying the post. While the conditions may not fit both, there are pros and cons as well. At Centurion, India’s biggest issue was streaming the run-flow and bowl dot balls that could generate pressure. With the pace attack being inexperienced, playing two spinners with experience on their back may not be a bad idea after all. They will also strengthen the batting. The downside of playing both is, there is a strong chance that one of them is under-bowled. What about the pace attack? Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj would definitely start. But given how Prasidh Krishna struggled on his debut and Shardul Thakur’s expensive outing (went at over 5 RPO), India are pondering whether to include Mukesh Kumar. They have also added Avesh Khan, a seamer who is considered a natural fit to the red-ball, to the squad. One of Avesh’s strongest suits is to bowl long spells. With his ability to use the shoulder more, he could get a look-in if India believe he can complement Bumrah and Siraj. On the eve of the Test, skipper Rohit Sharma backed Prasidh to do well in these conditions, which means India could repose faith in him and if they play three seamers, he could well be in the XI. But if India chose to go with four seamers, then they have to pick between Shardul Thakur, Mukesh Kumar and Avesh Khan. With not much grass on the pitch, Shardul may not be handy to the conditions. Mukesh is again a seamer, who may not be able to extract bounce off the pitch, so will India be tempted to play Avesh?",Sports,ind vs sa nd test ashwin jadeja play together mukesh kumar avesh khan make debut table mountain background india uphill task mount comeback second final test south africa cape town outplay across departments centurion face plenty question regard team combination balance talk point batsmen show faith innings centurion indias bat unit fail cope bounce seam movement condition suppose compact tight guilty fail basics give bat unit transition india seek reinforcements unless force anybodys unavailability case abhimanyu easwaran spend another game warm bench expect change definitely bowl front shardul thakur hit shoulder couple days back train session isnt rule game ravindra jadeja miss first test back spasm fit available india call make regard make bowl combination also personnel space ashwin jadeja despite field two spinners australia england india field two spinners traditionally south africa come one spot sena countries india incline jadeja since offer something different lefthander see bat allrounder rather bowl allrounder southpaw though previously play one test south africa miss last four injury ashwin hand play seven test hasnt effective term wickets place however cape town see venue pitch could get dry crack could open day unlike centurion isnt much grass cover prasanna agoram work lions team south africas domestic circuit offer x dry grass water couple days grass come crack open spinners come play later interest see combination india come photo pitch accompany post condition may fit pros con well centurion indias biggest issue stream runflow bowl dot ball could generate pressure pace attack inexperienced play two spinners experience back may bad idea also strengthen bat downside play strong chance one underbowled pace attack jasprit bumrah mohammed siraj would definitely start give prasidh krishna struggle debut shardul thakurs expensive out go rpo india ponder whether include mukesh kumar also add avesh khan seamer consider natural fit redball squad one aveshs strongest suit bowl long spell ability use shoulder could get lookin india believe complement bumrah siraj eve test skipper rohit sharma back prasidh well condition mean india could repose faith play three seamers could well xi india choose go four seamers pick shardul thakur mukesh kumar avesh khan much grass pitch shardul may handy condition mukesh seamer may able extract bounce pitch india tempt play avesh,2
86,"India vs South Africa: Can Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill step up during Cape Town Test?","India’s tours to South Africa are like primetime soap operas without the endless drag. They all look and feel the same. Just the names and characters change. The latest trip is unfolding like the nine others to the country. The usual themes have played out—lost opportunities, false hopes and swift implosions, the pain numbed somewhat by stirring individual performances. A twist here, a tweak there, the script takes the much-trodden route. So just replace Sachin Tendulkar’s Centurion masterclass with KL Rahul’s virtuosic hundred at the same venue; just erase Javagal Srinath’s name and scrawl that of Bumrah. Instead of Durban 1996 read Centurion 2023. Now, they reach Cape Town, a venue that evokes the splendor of nature as well as bitter memories. Twice have India landed in the Western Cape with the hope of conquering the final frontier; twice they left the city battered. Once, they came within touching distance, only to be blunted by the greatest all-rounder of this century. The Indian audience of a certain vintage could read an invisible sentence— “Cape of Missed Chances”— on the face of the imposing Table Mountain. At least this time, they are saved from the pain of not winning a series here. The final frontier remains unconquered, giving a sense of context to the next tour, but there are other races to be won, other questions remain to be answered. The first and foremost — are India reacquiring their poor traveller’s tag under Rahul Dravid? In the last six Tests outside of the West Indies, his men have lost five games. Two of them were one-off Tests; one was his first tour in charge, and the sixth was the Centurion one. So it’s harsh to presume that they are sore travelers yet. But the reputation is quickly developing and the next overseas assignment is the long sojourn Down Under at the end of the year. Some old flaws have resurfaced. Like the snap-of-the-fingers collapses, inconsistent top-three, lack of runs down the order, inability to polish off the lower-order, listless support bowlers, over-dependent on individual performances, the symptoms point to the return 90s syndrome. Just when it seemed that the malaise had been wiped off, another variant had sprung, another wave gripping India’s Test team. In these six Tests, India have shuffled different openers and tried four different combinations. It could be down to loss of form, or injuries, only once has a pair of openers strung 45-plus runs (Mayank Agarwal and Rahul in Centurion 2021-22). So the sooner Yashasvi Jaiswal settles down, the better it is for both the team and individual. The princely yield in the Caribbeans would all be forgotten if he continues to struggle against quality seamers in hostile conditions. The critics would instantly ridicule him as a flat-track bully. The fate is similar for a clutch of other youngsters teething in, and finding their ways in Test cricket. It’s high time Shubman Gill came up with a performance that justifies the hype around him as the inheritor of Virat Kohli ’s mantle. Ditto Shreyas Iyer. Combine the stutter of the youth brigade with the stumble of Rohit Sharma in Centurion, India’s batting in this series has been just about Rahul and Virat Kohli. Like in the past days—Tendulkar and Mohammed Azharuddin, or just Tendulkar alone (as had often been the case). The plight is similar on the pace-bowling front too. At SuperSport Park it was just Bumrah; the second most incisive bowler was off-spinner Ravi Ashwin. Just as Javagal Srinath and Anil Kumble were back in the day. Mohammed Siraj was damningly erratic; Prasidh Krishna is uncut and needs to put in hard yards in the domestic cricket to harness his gifts; Shardul Thakur was all bluster and no blast. The bench does not offer much hope either. Mukesh Kumar could be as good or bad a pick as Prasidh. The selectors summoning Avesh Khan to the Test squad is a definite sign of panic. Whether he is handed the debut or not, India’s once stacked stable of thoroughbreds seems thinly-stocked. The digression of Ishant Sharma, the baffling omission of Umesh Yadav and the non-emergence of Navdeep Saini has made Mohammed Shami’s injury-induced layoff look like a vacuum that cannot be filled. Again, you could strike parallels with the past. Zaheer Khan limps off and suddenly India looks beaten already. The comeback, thus, looks unlikely though not impossible. They could take refuge from the admirable collection of comeback narratives outside the subcontinent from the past. Oval 2021, Melbourne 2021, Durban 2010, Perth 2008, the years and venues leap off from the memory. Not all those teams were flawless, but they found courage in adversity. Whether Rohit’s men — a team in flux and without key figures (Shami and Rishabh Pant) — have the courage and quality to bounce back will define his captaincy. The return of all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja would strengthen the team, but one man alone cannot make a drastic difference. That’s the curse of two-episode Test rubbers too. It is a blur, unfolding so rapidly that the thrill and drama of comeback narratives is nonexistent. Even before a team settles down, even before they acclimatize to the weather and wind, even before they grasp the conditions and size up the bowlers, they have boarded their flights home. For the (niche) audience, it’s like the five-act play is crunched to two acts because there would be a bigger show in town in a fortnight, or there is little commercial viability, or there simply is no need for a longer fare. So five days after their Centurion capitulation, they reach Cape Town, 1,455 kilometres down to the tip of the continent. And in this time, India have to quickly solve the same issues that have crippled the captains of the past too. Lest, they would leave these shores with another wave of pain and regret.",Sports,india vs south africa yashasvi jaiswal shubman gill step cape town test indias tour south africa like primetime soap operas without endless drag look feel name character change latest trip unfold like nine others country usual theme play outlost opportunities false hop swift implosions pain numb somewhat stir individual performances twist tweak script take muchtrodden route replace sachin tendulkars centurion masterclass kl rahuls virtuosic hundred venue erase javagal srinaths name scrawl bumrah instead durban read centurion reach cape town venue evoke splendor nature well bitter memories twice india land western cape hope conquer final frontier twice leave city batter come within touch distance blunt greatest allrounder century indian audience certain vintage could read invisible sentence cape miss chance face impose table mountain least time save pain win series final frontier remain unconquered give sense context next tour race question remain answer first foremost india reacquiring poor travellers tag rahul dravid last six test outside west indies men lose five game two oneoff test one first tour charge sixth centurion one harsh presume sore travelers yet reputation quickly develop next overseas assignment long sojourn end year old flaw resurface like snapofthefingers collapse inconsistent topthree lack run order inability polish lowerorder listless support bowlers overdependent individual performances symptoms point return syndrome seem malaise wipe another variant spring another wave grip indias test team six test india shuffle different openers try four different combinations could loss form injuries pair openers string plus run mayank agarwal rahul centurion sooner yashasvi jaiswal settle better team individual princely yield caribbeans would forget continue struggle quality seamers hostile condition critics would instantly ridicule flattrack bully fate similar clutch youngsters teethe find ways test cricket high time shubman gill come performance justify hype around inheritor virat kohli mantle ditto shreyas iyer combine stutter youth brigade stumble rohit sharma centurion indias bat series rahul virat kohli like past daystendulkar mohammed azharuddin tendulkar alone often case plight similar pacebowling front supersport park bumrah second incisive bowler offspinner ravi ashwin javagal srinath anil kumble back day mohammed siraj damningly erratic prasidh krishna uncut need put hard yards domestic cricket harness gift shardul thakur bluster blast bench offer much hope either mukesh kumar could good bad pick prasidh selectors summon avesh khan test squad definite sign panic whether hand debut indias stack stable thoroughbreds seem thinlystocked digression ishant sharma baffle omission umesh yadav nonemergence navdeep saini make mohammed shamis injuryinduced layoff look like vacuum cannot fill could strike parallel past zaheer khan limp suddenly india look beat already comeback thus look unlikely though impossible could take refuge admirable collection comeback narratives outside subcontinent past oval melbourne durban perth years venues leap memory team flawless find courage adversity whether rohits men team flux without key figure shami rishabh pant courage quality bounce back define captaincy return allrounder ravindra jadeja would strengthen team one man alone cannot make drastic difference thats curse twoepisode test rubber blur unfold rapidly thrill drama comeback narratives nonexistent even team settle even acclimatize weather wind even grasp condition size bowlers board flight home niche audience like fiveact play crunch two act would bigger show town fortnight little commercial viability simply need longer fare five days centurion capitulation reach cape town kilometres tip continent time india quickly solve issue cripple captain past lest would leave shore another wave pain regret,2
87,"David Warner’s touching tribute to Phil Hughes ahead of farewell Test in Sydney: ‘If he was still with us, he’d be in my or Usman Khawaja’s position’","Australia opener David Warner, who’ll play his last Test starting Wednesday in Sydney, on Tuesday remembered his former teammate, the late Phil Hughes. Hughes, who died at the age of 25 off a cricket ball blow to the neck while batting at the SCG during a Sheffield Shield match, had featured across 26 Test matches, 25 ODIs and a T20I for Australia. Warner recalled being at the venue when Hughes was hit and how his passing affected the team. “For us, being here when he fell that day, was quite sad and terrible,” Warner said, almost in a choke. “Still today, it hits us hard. I’ve always seen him at the other end. All the boys know he’s looking down upon us. His character, his energy and his smile lit up the room. Best mates with everyone, no one would ever say a bad word about him.” The southpaw went on to add that he had a firm belief that Hughes was going to be “one of our greatest opening batters ever.” “He had every shot in the book. I truly, truly believe today – if he was still with us – he’d be in my position or Uzzie’s (Usman Khawaja) position (in the Test team),” he said. Hughes’ passing in 2014 had left Australia in a state of mourning. At the time, he’d been in contention for the top spot in Australian batting ahead of the four-match series against India. The opener’s funeral in his hometown of Macksville was also attended by India’s stand in skipper at the time, Virat Kohli, head coach Duncan Fletcher and Team Director Ravi Shastri.

88,Pat Cummins on the perfect farewell for David Warner: ‘A hundred and a leg spinner to take the last wicket’,"All is in readiness for David Warner to take the field in his final Test match for Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground starting Wednesday against Pakistan. The southpaw’s 112th Test match has been the big talk this week in Australia and skipper Pat Cummins has visualized the perfect scenario for the curtains to come down upon his opener’s career. “Best-case scenario is a hundred and maybe a leg-spinner to take the last wicket of the game out of the rough,” Cummins would grinningly tell members of the press on Tuesday at the SCG. “[Hopefully there is] just a fantastic turnout here, which I’m sure it will be with everyone behind him. If he could score some runs and go off in style with a few fours and sixes, I think that’d be a pretty fitting end. ‘Warner Week’ has started,” he added. Cummins was all praise for the southpaw, who also announced his retirement from the ODIs earlier this week, and referred to his contributions beyond the runs. “We spend a lot of time on the road and it can be monotonous, but with Davey, it never is. There is always something going on. He always brings plenty of energy to the group. If the group is a little low on energy, he ramps it up a bit and gets us up and going,” Cummins said. On the conditions at play in Sydney, the Aussie skipper added,  “The weather looks pretty good this week and that’s not always the case in Sydney. I had a look yesterday and [the pitch] looks good. The groundsman seems happy with where it’s at. It looks like decent coverage of grass, so it should be a good week ahead.” Having won both in Perth and Melbourne, the hosts have an unassailable lead over Pakistan, who are yet to win a Test match in Australia since 1995.

89,"India vs South Africa 2nd Test tip-off XI: Ravindra Jadeja and Mukesh Kumar set to return, toss-up between R Ashwin and Shardul Thakur","India vs South Africa 2nd Test: After a dismal performance in Centurion, team India would be looking to win the second Test and level the two-match series. With one loss and one draw in three Tests in the new World Test Championship cycle, India would be desperate for a win, at the venue where they visitors have lost four of their previous six games. India are sixth in the nine-team table with 14 points (38.89 PCT) and a defeat will dent their standing further. A win would be great for the morale of the team, who is still trying to pick up the pieces after their World Cup final loss. India look set to revamp their bowling attack. They are also likely to make at least one more change to their bowling line-up. All-rounder Ravindra Jadeja is expected to return after missing the opening Test due to back spasm. Jadeja will add depth to India’s batting, which crumbled in Centurion, as well as being a capable bowler. Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj maintained reasonable control in Centurion but lacked support from debutant Prasidh Krishna. The Karnataka pacer was included in the team to get the trampoline boucne from the Centurion surface. However, he struggled with his lengths and looke undercooked. Mukesh on the other hand is taking a rapid stride in his interntaional career. His ability to move the ball both ways and the control makes him more dangerous bowler than Praisdh. R Ashwin was definitely underutilized by skipper Rohit Sharma in the first Test. The veteran spinner was also unlucky after KL Rahul dropped a straightforward catch. It will be prudent for India to retain the veteran off-spinner, who is also a better batsman than Shardul Thakur, who had a forgettable match. Shardul leaked 101 runs in 19 overs. Fast bowler Gerald Coetzee who suffered a pelvic injury during South Africa’s win, will miss the second Test. Given India’s struggle against quality fast bowling, the Proteas would be tempted to play an all-pace attack. In that scenario, Lungi Ngidi, who was judged not to have fully recovered from an ankle injury, might make the cut. The toss will be crucial at Newlands which is recording temperatures of 33 to 34 degrees. Despite decent grass covering, the pitch will be a batting paradise with little help for spinners from either side.

90,"I’d change my technique to copy Virat Kohli, and if that failed I’d try copy Rohit Sharma: David Bedingham","South Africa’s David Bedingham reveals he used try and copy the technique of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma in his teen years and call the Indian batsmen as his favourites by a country mile. Bedingham, who scored a fluid 56 in Centurion said growing up his crickeing heroes were Herschelle Gibbs and Jacques Kallis but it was Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma who fascinated him during his teenage years. “Definitely Herschelle Gibbs. Jacques Kallis was from my school [Wynberg Boys’ High] … or, I was from his school. So I tended to watch those two,” he told reporters ahead of the second Test in Newlands.  “My two favourites among Indian players are Sharma and Kohli. I think when I was between 13-18, I was trying to mould my technique like theirs (Kallis and Gibbs) and when I had a bad game, I changed my technique to copy Kohli’s or try probably Sharma’s,” said Bedingham. Bedingham has played English county cricket for Durham since 2020, and he is also grateful that he got an opportunity to interact with England Test skipper Ben Stokes during his stint with Durham. “I think we talked a lot. I think he refrained from talking about cricket a lot. He spoke about dealing with pressures, speaking to a world-class player like him did help handle the pressure better during the first Test,” Bedingham said about his interactions with Stokes. Bedingham has played nearly 90 first-class games before making his international debut.  “Everything happens for a reason. Fine if it (Test debut) would have happened five years ago but I have played so much First-Class cricket that I learnt the ups and downs. It prepares you better for Test cricket. “I think because of all my experiences in First-Class cricket, I can keep my emotions in check,” he said.

91,Two of the big questions for 2024: Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli for T20 World Cup? PR Sreejesh or Krishan Pathak for Paris?,"It’s not about sentiments, to give Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli potentially one last shot at winning the T20 World Cup. But there is no reason to look beyond them. Kohli was the tournament’s highest run-getter and played one of the all-time great T20 knocks by an Indian batsman. He hasn’t played another T20I since India’s semifinal exit in the 2022 World Cup, but enjoyed a prosperous IPL. The tally of 639 runs is his second-best run-haul ever, so is the strike rate that is a nudge below 140. If any, he has only reinvigorated his T20 game and looks in no mood to slow down. Rohit’s recent T20I outings have not been quite eye-catching. but the freedom he displayed in the ODI World Cup is a reliable indicator of his mindset and method. A cricketer like him should not be valued merely through the prism of numbers in a particular format, but his recent form, even if it be in other formats. Little doubt that Rohit was India’s tempo-setter in the 50-over World Cup, the pin-up boy of their gung-ho approach. Though a spate of openers have performed in recent T20Is—Sai Sudharsan the most promising of them—Rohit towers above them all with his body of work, as it is with Kohli. Picking both risks being labelled conservative. But has not conservatism bore fruits in the T20 World Cup? A perfect case study is Australia’s squad that won the 2021 World Cup in UAE. It was a supposedly old and worn-out group, but when the big moments came, their wisdom and experience made a telling difference. A young, dynamic-looking team might win you bilateral series, give you fleeting thrills, but for the big tournaments, you need the big names, the past masters, inspired to make a big splash before their sneak into the sunset. Sandip G At the Tokyo Olympics, just two Indian athletes, Neeraj Chopra and discus thrower Kamalpreet Kaur, reached the finals of their events among the 26 participants. This is not counting the race walk events where only direct finals are the norm. This may paint a dismal picture of Indian athletics and would naturally add muscle to the argument whether every qualified athlete should be sent to the Games in the first place. But sports isn’t always about stats and data. Steeplechaser Avinash Sable’s national record-breaking effort wasn’t good enough for a spot in the finals. Likewise, the 4x400m men’s quartet couldn’t make the cut for the finale despite running their hearts out to rewrite an Asian record. “Fastest in Asia but not quick enough” read the The Indian Express headline, summing up the situation. Since these athletes did not make it to the finals can their solid performances just be binned? Of course not. Crystal ball gazing is the most futile activity that “sports experts” engage in. Don’t recall even a single athletics preview that backed Neeraj Chopra, an Olympics debutant, to finish on the podium. Qualifying for the Olympics in a measurable sport like athletics is no mean feat. The two-tier system- qualification guidelines and rankings – in athletics leaves little room for luck or any outside interference. Every athlete truly earns a spot and to deny them on the basis of their predictive potential is unfair. The experience athletes gain in such big-ticket events cannot be replicated in any training conditions. The only exception that should be made is in the case of injuries or fitness issues. The federation has the complete right to ascertain if an athlete is fully fit and not hiding injuries just to make it to the Games and earn the tag of an Olympian. That being said, every athlete in track and field who has qualified for the Olympics deserves to be on the flight to Paris. Andrew Amsan After two successive Olympics with not a medal in sight, the question over form or pedigree is bound to pop up. At the Tokyo Olympics, India had a vaunted set of shooters, all in their youth and none touched by failure. What followed next was a capitulation of a 15-member team touted for multiple medals. Going into Paris, India is set to host four Olympics trials, something suggested by former national rifle coach Joydeep Karmakar. When Karmakar spoke of what his vision of the trials would be to The Indian Express, he felt that to treat the trials for the Olympics at a higher plane than the Olympics itself would yield a degree of shooter that could face the rigours of a tournament where India has wilted over the past two editions. Yes there would still be the points system where certain athletes who had won quota places and had victories at World Championships would get bonus points, but the percentages and bonus would not be as damning as earlier. Effectively, perform well at three of the four trials and an Olympic spot is yours. Fail in May, and watch an Indian in your event vie for a medal in Paris in July/August. Prioritising the form of a shooter in May over quota winners makes sense as long as the quota wasn’t won at a World Championship. Take the case of Rudrankshh Patil. It would be a travesty if a World Championship gold medallist in the current Olympic cycle is denied a spot on the team, mainly due to the tough circumstances of winning a gold that is only topped in its competitiveness and competition by the Olympics. There could be an argument that this particular circumstance allows for form to not be a consideration. But barring that, does a country that has such depth in its rifle team, and potential in its pistol team, have anything to lose giving form a chance, considering just how poorly Rio and Tokyo went? Shashank Nair A season with 11 first round exits from 22 international meets, and ending with a loss to an unheralded opponent at the Nationals means Lakshya Sen is staring at an uphill challenge in qualifying for the Olympics. His defense-heavy style, though dazzling with dives and reflex pickups, was always going to be punishing on the body in the long run. But are things so dire that he needs to switch to an attacking game? Some of Sen’s shots have gotten predictable, and opponents are reading him rather easily. His body language is misunderstood as being casual, when it is in fact his lack of attacking variations from the back that make it a technical issue more than a temperamental one. It is evident that he will need to find offensive weapons to cut short the interminable rallies before he runs out of patience as is his wont. The trouble with the switch is that the shoulder injury has seen him lose timing on his smashes, and he has been unable to kill the bird getting drawn into endless exchanges. Anup Sridhar is working earnestly, though Vimal Kumar has sensed the urgency of his flailing qualification campaign and will resume travelling for Malaysia, India and Indonesia events. The sheer pressure and procedure to qualify for Paris Games – he needs to be Top 16 in next 4 months – can prove daunting. Just a few good results at Canada and Japan – mean Sen’s lead-up is one right mess, and his team is understandably worried. He was at his fearless best against Shi Yuqi in the Asiad team finals against China. The title at Canada where he defeated world champ Kunlavut and top Chinese youngster Li Shifeng with a confident attacking game, raises hopes of that style, yielding returns. And he is a certified big occasion player, capable of stitching up a dazzling run at Paris. If only he qualifies. Shivani Naik What’s the one thing other than the obvious Olympic medals that links Sushil Kumar, Yogeshwar Dutt, Bajrang Punia and Ravi Dahiya? The fabled Chhatrasal Stadium, where each of them mastered their art, yes. But there’s another link that ties them all – their march to the Olympic podium was overseen by a foreign expert. Sakshi Malik remains an outlier in that she’s the only medal-winning wrestler since Sushil triggered the unprecedented spree in 2008 to stand on the podium without having to rely on outside support. For the rest, the foreign hand proved to be the ultimate difference. Sushil and Yogeshwar spent months together with Georgian Vladimir Merstervishvili before the London Games. Bajrang had Shako Bendinitis, also from Georgia, and Ravi had Russia’s Kamal Malikov in their corners at Tokyo. As Indian wrestling grappled with controversies on multiple fronts – with former president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh at the centre of them all – the needs of the wrestlers seem to have gone unnoticed. The Olympic hopefuls have been crying for professional help from abroad which will not just improve their qualification chances but, as history has proven, also be a key factor in challenging for a medal. Foreign coaches open the wrestlers’ eyes to modern techniques, expose them to the world of sports science and are better at improvising strategies during a bout and communicating them effectively from the side of the mat. It’s something, wrestlers say, their Indian trainers haven’t been able to do so well. Only Deepak Punia, one of the most consistent performers over the last four years, has a foreign personal coach – Russia’s Kamal Malikov, who was Ravi’s coach in Tokyo. And it is learnt Bajrang will soon avail the services of another Russia-born wrestler, Ali Shabanov. Their arrangements have been done independently through their backers, not by the federation or the government. The rest have been left to fend for themselves. Wrestling is the only sport this century to win at least one medal at the last four Games. It’ll be a shame if all the administrative mismanagement ends this fine run. Mihir Vasavda At the Tokyo Olympics, a long wait for Indian hockey came to an end. After 41 years, the Indian men’s team returned to the podium. And crucial to that bronze medal was a moment that will go down in Indian hockey folklore. With barely any time left on the clock – 6.4 seconds to be precise – Germany got a penalty corner while trailing 4-5. The shot on goal was well struck, but Sreejesh got his left hand out in time and not just saved it, but palmed it away far enough to ensure there was no rebound. In those milliseconds, he ensured India’s dream – his dream – was realised. He regards that as perhaps the most important save of his career. Fast forward three years, and the 35-year-old is still very much in contention. But his position as India’s No 1 goalkeeper won’t be straightforward this time around. The rise of Krishan Bahadur Pathak, nearly a decade younger than Sreejesh, is going to make that decision tricky for the Indian management. Under Craig Fulton, as we saw under Graham Reid, India have continued to rotate their two main goalkeepers each quarter irrespective of the magnitude of the match they are playing. That constant rotation has kept Sreejesh on his toes, but more importantly, has allowed Pathak to grow in confidence. The youngster was part of the Tokyo squad but wasn’t in the playing list and it was an obvious decision for the think-tank to trust Sreejesh. Pathak has impressed in the chances he has received in recent times, with his ability to make reflex saves with the stick standing out in the Pro League. It will be the Pro League where once again presumably he will be given the chances to stake his claim. India’s Tokyo campaign ended with iconic images of Sreejesh perched on top of the posts. He has maintained his high standards since too but whether he will be present in the posts between Paris is an interesting decision that awaits Fulton and Co.

92,The important thing is to control the middle: Magnus Carlsen discusses similarities between football and chess with Pep Guardiola,"Two modern icons met face to face recently as treble winning coach Pep Guardiola and 5-time chess world champion Magnus Carlsen engaged in riveting conversation. In a video shared by Puma, Carlsen who is a known football fan and a supporter of Spanish giants Real Madrid, explained to Guardiola how the two sports were similar. “The important thing is to control the middle. If you control the middle, you control the pitch or the board,” Carlsen said while also adding that he used to play football in his formative years but because he was better at chess, he pursued that. Watch the full video here👇https://t.co/bZSPN0tjLQ — Magnus Carlsen (@MagnusCarlsen) December 12, 2023 “Another thing is that often in chess you attack on one side, force the opponent to overload and then you switch and you have an advantage on the other side. In terms of space, it’s remarkably similar,” Carlsen would continue. “I think the way you have to take defenders away with the attack depends on the movement of the opponent. You must pay attention to what the opponent does in every single movement and react to that. Magnus has two hours to make the next movement. We have a second to react or take a decision,” Guardiola would chip in clearly impressed by Carlsen’s insights. They would then go on to watch some memorable moments in their career with Carlsen later posting on X, “The conversation? It was not horrible.” This is not the first time a chess board and footballers have intersected. In 2022, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, shared a picture that raked up millions of likes within hours of being posted. The photograph, which was taken as part of the French luxury brand Louis Vuitton’s campaign, shows the players indulging in a game of chess, while the chess board is held on an LV trunk.

93,Trump takes Colorado ballot disqualification to US Supreme Court,"Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday asked the US Supreme Court to intervene after Colorado’s top court disqualified him from the state’s Republican primary ballot for engaging in insurrection leading up to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Trump, the frontrunner for the Republican 2024 presidential nomination, is contesting the December 19 Colorado Supreme Court decision that disqualified him under a constitutional provision barring anyone who “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” from holding public office. The state high court had already put its decision on hold until January 4, stating that Trump would remain on the ballot if he appealed. Trump’s filing places a politically explosive case before the nation’s highest judicial body, whose 6-3 conservative majority includes three of his own appointees. The justices’ action will shape a wider effort to disqualify Trump from other state ballots as the 2024 election draws closer. In the filing, Trump’s lawyers asked the justices to “summarily reverse” the Colorado Supreme Court because the question of presidential eligibility is reserved for Congress. The state court’s decision marks “the first time in the history of the United States that the judiciary has prevented voters from casting ballots for the leading major-party presidential candidate,” the lawyers said, adding that the ruling “is not and cannot be correct.” The Jan. 6 attack was an attempt by Trump’s supporters to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democratic President Joe Biden, which Trump falsely claims was the result of fraud. The Colorado court’s historic ruling marked the first time in history that Section 3 of the US Constitution’s Fourteenth Amendment – the so-called disqualification clause – had been used to deem a presidential candidate ineligible for the White House. Trump has also appealed to a Maine state court a decision by that state’s top election official barring him from the primary ballot under the same constitutional provision at issue in the Colorado case. Disqualification Clause The Colorado Supreme Court ruling came in a lawsuit filed by Republican and unaffiliated voters, and backed by watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, seeking to bar Trump from the nominating primary and future elections under the disqualification clause. Section 3 bars from holding office any “officer of the United States” who took an oath “to support the Constitution of the United States” and then “engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.” The amendment was ratified in the aftermath of the American Civil War of 1861-1865 in which 11 southern states seceded from the union. The 4-3 Colorado Supreme Court ruling reversed a lower court judge’s conclusion that Trump engaged in insurrection by inciting his supporters to violence, but as president, he was not an “officer of the United States” who could be disqualified under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Colorado court concluded that Trump’s role in instigating violence at the Capitol as lawmakers met to certify the results of the 2020 election constituted engaging in insurrection, and that the presidency is covered by the insurrection provision. “President Trump asks us to hold that Section Three disqualifies every oath-breaking insurrectionist except the most powerful one and that it bars oath-breakers from virtually every office, both state and federal, except the highest one in the land. Both results are inconsistent with the plain language and history of Section Three,” the majority wrote. Acknowledging the magnitude of the case, the majority said, “We are likewise mindful of our solemn duty to apply the law, without fear or favor, and without being swayed by public reaction to the decisions that the law mandates we reach.” Trump’s lawyers argued that his speech to supporters on the day of the riot was protected by his right to free speech, adding that the constitutional amendment does not apply to U.S. presidents and that Congress would need to vote to disqualify a candidate. Courts have rejected several lawsuits seeking to keep Trump off the primary ballot in other states. Minnesota’s top court rebuffed an effort to disqualify Trump from the Republican primary in that state but did not rule on his overall eligibility to serve as president.",World,trump take colorado ballot disqualification us supreme court former president donald trump wednesday ask us supreme court intervene colorados top court disqualify state republican primary ballot engage insurrection lead january attack us capitol trump frontrunner republican presidential nomination contest december colorado supreme court decision disqualify constitutional provision bar anyone engage insurrection rebellion hold public office state high court already put decision hold january state trump would remain ballot appeal trump file place politically explosive case nations highest judicial body whose conservative majority include three appointees justices action shape wider effort disqualify trump state ballot election draw closer file trump lawyers ask justices summarily reverse colorado supreme court question presidential eligibility reserve congress state court decision mark first time history unite state judiciary prevent voters cast ballot lead majorparty presidential candidate lawyers say add rule cannot correct jan attack attempt trump supporters overturn election loss democratic president joe biden trump falsely claim result fraud colorado court historic rule mark first time history section us constitutions fourteenth amendment socalled disqualification clause use deem presidential candidate ineligible white house trump also appeal maine state court decision state top election official bar primary ballot constitutional provision issue colorado case disqualification clause colorado supreme court rule come lawsuit file republican unaffiliated voters back watchdog group citizens responsibility ethics washington seek bar trump nominate primary future elections disqualification clause section bar hold office officer unite state take oath support constitution unite state engage insurrection rebellion give aid comfort enemies thereof amendment ratify aftermath american civil war southern state secede union colorado supreme court rule reverse lower court judge conclusion trump engage insurrection incite supporters violence president officer unite state could disqualify fourteenth amendment colorado court conclude trump role instigate violence capitol lawmakers meet certify result election constitute engage insurrection presidency cover insurrection provision president trump ask us hold section three disqualify every oathbreaking insurrectionist except powerful one bar oathbreakers virtually every office state federal except highest one land result inconsistent plain language history section three majority write acknowledge magnitude case majority say likewise mindful solemn duty apply law without fear favor without sway public reaction decisions law mandate reach trump lawyers argue speech supporters day riot protect right free speech add constitutional amendment apply us presidents congress would need vote disqualify candidate court reject several lawsuits seek keep trump primary ballot state minnesotas top court rebuff effort disqualify trump republican primary state rule overall eligibility serve president,3
94,Unsealed court records offer new detail on old sex abuse allegations against Jeffrey Epstein,"Amid great hype, a court began to release a new batch of previously secret court documents late Wednesday related to Jeffrey Epstein, the jet-setting financier who killed himself in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. Social media has been rife in recent weeks with posts speculating the documents would include a list of rich and powerful men who were Epstein’s “clients” or “co-conspirators.” There was no such list. The initial collection of around 40 documents made public largely contained material that had been released previously, or exhaustively had been covered in nearly two decades’ worth of newspaper stories, TV documentaries, interviews and books about the Epstein scandal. Still, the records — which included transcripts of interviews with some of Epstein’s victims — contained reminders that Epstein surrounded himself with famous and powerful figures, including a few who have also been accused of misconduct. There were mentions of Epstein’s past friendship with Bill Clinton — who is not accused of any wrongdoing — and of Britain’s Prince Andrew, who previously settled a lawsuit accusing him of having sex with a 17-year-old girl who traveled with Epstein. Epstein accuser Johanna Sjoberg testified in a newly released deposition that she once met Michael Jackson at Epstein’s Palm Beach, Florida, home, but that nothing untoward happened with the late pop icon. The documents being unsealed are related to a lawsuit filed in 2015 by one of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Giuffre. She is one of the dozens of women who sued Epstein saying he had abused them at his homes in Florida, New York, the US Virgin Islands and New Mexico. This particular suit was against Epstein’s former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 of helping recruit Epstein’s victims and is serving a 20-year prison term. Epstein, a millionaire known for associating with celebrities, politicians, billionaires and academic stars, killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on a sex-trafficking charge. Giuffre’s lawsuit against Maxwell was settled in 2017, but the court had kept some court documents blacked-out or sealed because of concerns about the privacy rights of Epstein’s victims and other people whose names had come up during the legal battle. Only around 40 of those documents were made public Wednesday. More will be released in coming days. Among records released Wednesday were court memos in which lawyers for Giuffre complained that some of the women who had worked for Epstein were proving difficult to serve with subpoenas, as was Epstein himself. Two women had invoked their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when questioned in other lawsuits about whether they had been involved in procuring young women for Epstein to abuse. Maxwell, in her deposition, chaffed at being asked questions about whether she had ever arranged for Giuffre or other women to have sexual encounters with Prince Andrew, or purchased sex toys or revealing outfits, or seen young, topless women at Epstein’s home. One person who had been on Epstein’s domestic staff said in a deposition that he felt uncomfortable with the number of young women showing up at the house, and felt threatened by Maxwell to stay quiet after he left his job. Other documents included legal arguments over whether Giuffre should be allowed more time to depose potential witnesses, including Clinton. Giuffre never alleged he was involved in illegal behavior, but her attorneys said the former president was a “key person who can provide information about his close relationship” with Maxwell and Epstein. Maxwell’s attorneys countered that Clinton testimony was not relevant and that Giuffre’s attorneys didn’t diligently try to subpoena him to testify. The records included the depositions of several of Epstein’s victims, many of whom have told their stories publicly previously. Besides the mention of Michael Jackson, Sjoberg’s May 2016 deposition also shed new light on an April 2001 trip to New York in which she said Prince Andrew touched her breast while they posed for a photo at Epstein’s Manhattan town house. In the testimony, some of which appeared as excerpts in previous court filings, Sjoberg said she and Giuffre had flown with Epstein to New York on his private jet. Maxwell and Prince Andrew met them there, she said. At one point, she testified, Maxwell called her to an upstairs closet where they pulled out a puppet of Prince Andrew that had been made for a BBC program. “It looked like him,” Sjoberg said. “And she brought it down and presented it to him; and that was a great joke, because apparently it was a production from a show on BBC.” “And they decided to take a picture with it, in which Virginia and Andrew sat on a couch. They put the puppet on Virginia’s lap, and I sat on Andrew’s lap, and they put the puppet’s hand on Virginia’s breast, and Andrew put his hand on my breast, and they took a photo.” On the way to New York, Sjoberg testified, Epstein’s jet diverted to Atlantic City, New Jersey, and spent a few hours at one of Donald Trump’s casinos, because of bad weather. Upon hearing the change of plans, Sjoberg recalled Epstein saying, “Great, we’ll call up Trump and we’ll go to” the casino. Sjoberg wasn’t asked if they’d met up with Trump that night. Later in her testimony, she said she was never asked to give Trump a massage. Sjoberg also testified that though she never met Clinton, Epstein once remarked to her that “Clinton likes them young,” a remark she took as a reference to young women or girls. In her deposition, Giuffre said the summer she turned 17, she was lured away from a job as a spa attendant at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club to become a “masseuse” for Epstein — a job that involved performing sexual acts. She settled a lawsuit against Prince Andrew in 2022 in which she claimed he had sexually abused her during a trip to London. That same year, Giuffre withdrew an accusation she had made against Epstein’s former attorney, law professor Alan Dershowitz, saying she “ may have made a mistake ” in identifying him as an abuser. The records released Wednesday included many references to Jean-Luc Brunel, a French modeling agent close to Epstein who was awaiting trial on charges that he raped underage girls when he killed himself in a Paris jail in 2022. Giuffre was among the women who had accused Brunel of sexual abuse. Clinton’s name also came up because Guiffre was questioned by Maxwell’s lawyers about inaccuracies in newspaper reports about her time with Epstein, including a story quoting her as saying she had ridden in a helicopter with Clinton and flirted with Trump. Giuffre said neither of those things actually happened. The judge said a handful of names should remain blacked out in the documents because they would identify people who were sexually abused. The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they decide to tell their stories publicly, as Giuffre has done. Even before the documents were released, misinformation about what was in them abounded. Social media users wrongly claimed that late-night host Jimmy Kimmel’s name might appear in the documents, spurred by a crack New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers made Tuesday on ESPN’s “The Pat McAfee Show.” Kimmel said in a response on X that he had never met Epstein and that Rodgers’ “reckless words put my family in danger.” “Keep it up and we will debate the facts further in court,” Kimmel wrote.",World,unseal court record offer new detail old sex abuse allegations jeffrey epstein amid great hype court begin release new batch previously secret court document late wednesday relate

95,"Imam gunned down outside US mosque; shooter remains at large, say officials","A New Jersey imam was gunned down outside his mosque before dawn on Wednesday, leaving authorities hunting for a shooter and saying they have found no evidence yet that an anti-Muslim bias played a part in the shooting. Imam Hassan Sharif was in his car when he was shot more than once at about 6 am near the Masjid-Muhammad Mosque in Newark, the state’s largest city, Essex County Prosecutor Ted Stephens said at a news conference. He was taken to a nearby hospital but died in the afternoon. “I know that in light of global events and with a rise in bias directed at many communities we are experiencing across our state — particularly the Muslim community — there are many in New Jersey right now who are feeling a heightened sense of fear or anxiety at the news of this slaying,” Attorney General Matt Platkin said. Despite that, Platkin said law enforcement has stepped up outreach to houses of worship, particularly Jewish and Muslim ones, explicitly acknowledging the tensions unfolding in many parts of the world amid the fighting in Gaza since the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel. Sharif had been a resident imam at the local mosque for five years, Newark Public Safety Director Fritz Fragé said. He remembered the imam as a leader in the interfaith community who worked to keep the city safe. “We share your pain and we promise to utilise the full resources of those here and those who are continuing to partner with us to make sure that this heinous crime is solved,” he said. The New Jersey chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organisation, called Sharif a “beacon of leadership and excellence” and said while the shooter’s motives are unknown, the group is advising all mosques to “remain cautious” while keeping their doors open.

97,Israel’s Mossad chief vows to hunt down Hamas members a day after senior figure killed in strike,"The chief of Israel’s Mossad intelligence service vowed Wednesday that the agency would hunt down every Hamas member involved in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, no matter where they are. His pledge came a day after the deputy head of the Palestinian militant group was killed in a suspected Israeli strike in Beirut. Israel has refused to comment on reports it carried out the killing, but the comments by David Barnea appeared to be the strongest indication yet it was behind the blast. He made a comparison to the aftermath of 1972 Munich Massacre, when Mossad agents tracked down and killed a string of Palestinian militants involved in killing Israeli athletes at that year’s Olympic games. Israel was on high alert Wednesday for an escalation with Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah militia after the strike in the Lebanese capital killed Saleh Arouri, the most senior Hamas member slain since the war in Gaza erupted nearly three months ago. The implications of the killing for the war remain unclear. Israel has killed several top Hamas leaders over the years, only to see them quickly replaced. The strike in Hezbollah’s southern Beirut stronghold could cause the low-intensity fighting along the Lebanon border to boil over into all-out war. Much depends on how Hassan Nasrallah — who has led Hezbollah since an Israeli strike killed his predecessor in 1992 — chooses to respond. He has previously vowed to retaliate for any Israeli targeting of allied militant leaders in Lebanon, and was expected to deliver a speech at 6 p.m. Wednesday. But Arouri’s killing provided a morale boost for Israelis still reeling from the Oct. 7 attack as the militants continue to put up stiff resistance in Gaza and hold scores of hostages. Barnea said the Mossad is “committed to settling accounts with the murderers who raided the Gaza envelope,” referring to the area of southern Israel that Hamas attacked. He vowed to pursue everyone involved, “directly or indirectly,” including “planners and envoys.” “It’ll take time, as it took time after the Munich massacre, but we will put our hands on them wherever they are,” he said. Barnea was speaking at the funeral of former Mossad head Zvi Zamir, who died at age 98 a day earlier. Zamir headed the intelligence agency at the time of the 1972 Munich Olympic attack, in which Palestinian militants killed 11 members of the Israeli delegation. Israel subsequently killed members of the Black September militant group who carried out the attack. LOOKING TO HEZBOLLAH Hezbollah and the Israeli military have been exchanging fire almost daily over the Israeli-Lebanese border since the war in Gaza began. But Nasrallah has appeared reluctant to escalate it further, perhaps fearing a repeat of the monthlong 2006 war, when Israel heavily bombed Beirut and southern Lebanon. A return of that destruction now would likely heighten opposition to Hezbollah within Lebanon. At the same time, Hezbollah also faces pressure to show support for its ally Hamas. Leaders in the Palestinian group clearly expect Hezbollah to have its back. In an interview Saturday, three days before Arouri’s killing, The Associated Press asked Beirut-based Hamas political official Osama Hamdan if the group was worried about the possibility of Israel assassinating its officials in Lebanon. Hamdan predicted that Hezbollah would not let that go unpunished, and an all-out war would ensue. “So why would Israel want to do that? Does it want a war” in Lebanon? he asked. “War can happen if Israel acts wrongly and aggressively,” he said, or war might not occur “if Israel takes a step back and acts in a way that is not aggressive against Lebanon.” Hezbollah vowed “response and punishment” for the strike. Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said Israeli forces were “on high readiness for any scenario.” Hezbollah said Wednesday that its fighters carried out at least eight attacks against Israeli posts along the border, including four using heavy warhead Burkan rockets. The statement did not directly link the fire to Arouri’s killing. The United States has sought to prevent any widening of the conflict, including by deploying two aircraft carriers and other military assets to the region. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was expected in the region this week. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials have repeatedly threatened to kill Hamas leaders wherever they are. The group’s Oct. 7 attack from Gaza into southern Israel killed around 1,200 people, and some 240 others were taken hostage. Israel claims to have killed a number of mid-level Hamas leaders in Gaza, but this would be the first time since the war that it has reached into another country to target the group’s top leaders, many of whom live in exile around the region. Arouri was the deputy of Hamas’ supreme political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, and headed the group’s presence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. He was also a key liaison with Hezbollah. ISRAEL SEEKS A ‘CLEAR VICTORY’ IN GAZA The focus of the war remains on Gaza, where Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Israel is seeking a “clear victory” over Hamas, which has ruled the territory since 2007. Israel’s air, ground and sea assault in Gaza has killed more than 22,300 people, two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. The count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. The campaign has driven some 85% of Gaza’s population from their homes, forcing hundreds of thousands of people into overcrowded shelters or teeming tent camps in Israeli-designated safe areas that the military has nevertheless bombed. A quarter of Gaza’s population face starvation, according to the United Nations, as Israeli restrictions and heavy fighting hinder aid delivery. Still, Israel appears far from achieving its goals of crushing Hamas and returning the estimated 129 hostages still held by the group. Gallant said several thousand Hamas fighters remain in northern Gaza, where Israeli troops have been battling militants for over two months and where entire neighborhoods have been blasted into rubble. Heavy fighting is also underway in central Gaza and the southern city of Khan Younis, where Israeli officials say Hamas’ military structure is still largely intact. Yehya Sinwar, Hamas’ top leader in Gaza, and his deputies have thus far eluded Israeli forces. Egypt, which along with Qatar has served as a mediator between Israel and Hamas, has proposed a multistage plan for ending the war in which all hostages would eventually be released in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Israel would withdraw from Gaza, and a government of Palestinian technocrats would govern Gaza and parts of the occupied West Bank until elections are held. Neither Israel nor Hamas have accepted the plan in its entirety, but neither has rejected it outright. An Israeli delegation was in Cairo on Wednesday to discuss the proposal, according to an Egyptian official who was not authorized to brief media and spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said the killing of Arouri was likely to hamper the negotiations for a couple days.",World,israels mossad chief vow hunt hamas members day senior figure kill strike chief israels mossad

98,Group of Indian-origin alleged fraudsters face trial in Scotland court,"A group of Indian-origin alleged fraudsters, including a woman, arrested and charged in connection with a high-value fraud face trial in a Scottish court in the coming weeks after they declined to enter a plea. According to Police Scotland, the arrests took place as part of an ongoing investigation into a “significant fraud” where an elderly woman in South Lanarkshire, Scotland, had a seven-figure sum in pounds stolen between May and August 2023. The force said six men and one woman were arrested on December 14 following a joint operation with policing partners in Essex, London, and Eastbourne. While two men aged 23 and 28 years were released on bail to appear at a later date, Londoners Mukesh Vippanapelli, 41, Vageesan Sunmugaraja, 50, and Sunil Theyath, 39, appeared at Airdrie Sheriff Court in North Lanarkshire on December 27. Their alleged accomplices Hafeeza Samreen, 34, and Umar Mohammed, 39, from Eastbourne, also appeared during the hearing, all charged with a “fraudulent scheme.” “It should be noted that the case is active for the purposes of the Contempt of Court Act 1981,” said the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service of Scotland, with reference to restrictions that now apply in the case which prevent further details from being reported on. Police Scotland said its officers were assisted by partners from the UK National Crime Agency’s National Economic Crime Centre and colleagues from other police forces. The arrests took place across the coastal towns of Eastbourne and Stansted, Dagenham, and East Ham in London and the investigation into the fraudulent scheme is said to be continuing.",World,group indianorigin allege fraudsters face trial scotland court group indianorigin allege fraudsters include woman arrest charge connection highvalue fraud face trial scottish court come weeks decline enter plea accord police scotland arrest take place part ongoing investigation significant fraud elderly woman south lanarkshire scotland sevenfigure sum pound steal may august force say six men one woman arrest december follow joint operation police partner essex london eastbourne two men age years release bail appear later date londoners mukesh vippanapelli vageesan sunmugaraja sunil theyath appear airdrie sheriff court north lanarkshire december allege accomplices hafeeza samreen umar mohammed eastbourne also appear hear charge fraudulent scheme note case active purpose contempt court act say crown office procurator fiscal service scotland reference restrictions apply case prevent detail report police scotland say officer assist partner uk national crime agencys national economic crime centre colleagues police force arrest take place across coastal towns eastbourne stansted dagenham east ham london investigation fraudulent scheme say continue,3
99,Over 100 killed in ‘terrorist attacks’ near Iranian Guards commander Soleimani’s tomb during ceremony,"Two explosions caused by ‘terrorist attacks’ killed more than 100 people and wounded scores at a ceremony in Iran to commemorate top commander Qassem Soleimani who was killed by a U.S. drone in 2020, Iranian officials said on Wednesday. Iranian state television reported a first and then a second blast during an anniversary event at the cemetery where Soleimani is buried in the southeastern city of Kerman. An unnamed official told the state news agency IRNA that “Two explosive devices planted along the road leading to Kerman’s Martyrs’ Cemetery were detonated remotely by terrorists”. Babak Yektaparast, a spokesperson for Iran’s emergency services, was reported as saying 73 people had been killed and 170 injured. State television said later that at least 100 people had been killed. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attacks. Videos aired by Iranian media showed dozens of bodies strewn around with some bystanders trying to attend to survivors and others hurrying to leave the blast area. “A terrible sound was heard there, despite all the security and safety measures. We are still investigating,” Reza Fallah, head of the Kerman Red Crescent Society, told state television. Red Crescent rescuers tended to wounded people at the ceremony, where hundreds of Iranians had gathered to mark the anniversary of Soleimani’s death. Some Iranian news agencies said the number of wounded people was much higher. “We are now evacuating the wounded and injured in the area. The crowd is huge and the job is quite hard all the paths to there are blocked,” Fallah said. The U.S. assassination of Soleimani in a drone attack at Baghdad airport and Tehran’s retaliation by attacking two Iraq military bases that house U.S. troops brought the United States and Iran close to full-blown conflict in 2020. As chief commander of the elite Quds force, the overseas arm of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Soleimani ran clandestine operations in foreign countries and was a key figure in Iran’s long-standing campaign to drive U.S. forces out of the Middle East. Tensions between Iran and Israel, along with its ally the United States, have reached a new high over Israel’s war on Iranian-backed Hamas militants in Gaza in retaliation for their Oct. 7 rampage through southern Israel. Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi militia have attacked ships they say have links to Israel in the entrance to the Red Sea, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes. U.S. forces have come under attack by Iran-backed militants in Iraq and Syria over Washington’s backing of Israel and have carried out their own retaliatory air strikes. On Monday an Israeli airstrike killed a senior leader of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards in Syria. Iran has in the past blamed Israel for attacks on individual people or places within its borders – claims which Israel has neither confirmed nor denied – but there was no indication of any foreign involvement in the explosions at Wednesday’s ceremony.",World,kill terrorist attack near iranian guard commander soleimanis tomb ceremony two explosions cause terrorist attack kill people wound score ceremony iran commemorate top commander qassem soleimani kill us drone iranian officials say wednesday iranian state television report first second blast anniversary event cemetery soleimani bury southeastern city kerman unnamed official tell state news agency irna two explosive devices plant along road lead kermans martyr cemetery detonate remotely terrorists babak yektaparast spokesperson irans emergency service report say people kill injure state television say later least people kill group yet claim responsibility attack videos air iranian media show dozens body strew around bystanders try attend survivors others hurry leave blast area terrible sound hear despite security safety measure still investigate reza fallah head kerman red crescent society tell state television red crescent rescuers tend wound people ceremony hundreds iranians gather mark anniversary soleimanis death iranian news agencies say number wound people much higher evacuate wound injure area crowd huge job quite hard paths block fallah say us assassination soleimani drone attack baghdad airport tehrans retaliation attack two iraq military base house us troop bring unite state iran close fullblown conflict chief commander elite quds force overseas arm irans revolutionary guard corps irgc soleimani run clandestine operations foreign countries key figure irans longstanding campaign drive us force middle east tensions iran israel along ally unite state reach new high israels war iranianbacked hamas militants gaza retaliation oct rampage southern israel yemens iranbacked houthi militia attack ship say link israel entrance red sea one worlds busiest ship lanes us force come attack iranbacked militants iraq syria washingtons back israel carry retaliatory air strike monday israeli airstrike kill senior leader irans revolutionary guard syria iran past blame israel attack individual people place within border claim israel neither confirm deny indication foreign involvement explosions wednesdays ceremony,3
100,Thousands of doctors in Britain walk off the job in their longest-ever strike,"Thousands of doctors walked off the job in Britain on Wednesday, the start of a six-day strike that was set to be the longest in the history of the state-funded National Health Service. Managers said tens of thousands scheduled appointments and operations will be cancelled during the walkout across England and Wales by junior doctors, those in the first years of their careers. The doctors, who form the backbone of hospital and clinic care, plan to stay off the job until 7 a.m. on Tuesday. Senior doctors and other medics have had to be drafted in to cover for emergency services, critical care and maternity services. Julian Hartley, chief executive of heath care managers’ organization NHS Providers, said the strike came at one of the toughest times of the year for the health service, “immediately after the Christmas and New Year period because of the pressures the demands, and of course we’ve got flu, we’ve got COVID.” “So there’s going to be an impact on patients that will be significant,” he said. Britain has endured a year of rolling strikes across the health sector as staff sought pay rises to offset the soaring cost of living. The walkouts have strained the already stretched health service still struggling to recover from backlogs created by the coronavirus pandemic. Nurses, ambulance crews and senior doctors have reached pay deals with the government, but the union representing junior doctors has held out, and negotiations have stalled. The government says it won’t hold further talks unless doctors call off the strike, while the union says it won’t negotiate unless it receives a “credible” pay offer. “The notion that we’re hellbent on calling strikes and all we want to do is call strikes is not what we want,” said Dr. Vivek Trivedi, co-chair of the British Medical Association’s Junior Doctors Committee. “What we want is to negotiate an offer we can put to our members and for our members to accept it.”",World,thousands doctor britain walk job longestever strike thousands doctor walk job britain wednesday start sixday strike set longest history statefunded national health service managers say tens thousands schedule appointments operations cancel walkout across england wales junior doctor first years career doctor form backbone hospital clinic care plan stay job tuesday senior doctor medics draft cover emergency service critical care maternity service julian hartley chief executive heath care managers organization nhs providers say strike come one toughest time year health service immediately christmas new year period pressure demand course weve get flu weve get covid theres go impact patients significant say britain endure year roll strike across health sector staff seek pay rise offset soar cost live walkouts strain already stretch health service still struggle recover backlog create coronavirus pandemic nurse ambulance crew senior doctor reach pay deal government union represent junior doctor hold negotiations stall government say wont hold talk unless doctor call strike union say wont negotiate unless receive credible pay offer notion hellbent call strike want call strike want say dr vivek trivedi cochair british medical associations junior doctor committee want negotiate offer put members members accept,3
101,Israel on alert for possible Hezbollah response after senior Hamas leader killed in Beirut strike,"Israel was on high alert for an escalation with Hezbollah on Wednesday after one of the top leaders of the Palestinian Hamas was killed in a strike in Beirut that was widely blamed on Israel and heightened the risk of a broader Middle East conflict. The killing of Saleh Arouri, the most senior Hamas member slain since the war in Gaza erupted nearly three months ago, provided a morale boost for Israelis still reeling from Hamas’ October 7 attack as the militants put up stiff resistance in Gaza and continue to hold scores of hostages. But its implications for the war remain unclear. Israel has killed several top Hamas leaders over the years, only to see them quickly replaced. And the strike in Hezbollah’s southern Beirut stronghold could cause the low-intensity fighting along the Lebanon border to boil over into all-out war. Much depends on how Hassan Nasrallah — who has led Hezbollah since an Israeli strike killed his predecessor in 1992 — chooses to respond. He has previously vowed to retaliate for any Israeli targeting of allied militant leaders in Lebanon, and was expected to deliver a speech at 6 p.m. (1600 GMT). Hezbollah and the Israeli military have been exchanging fire almost daily over the Israeli-Lebanese border since the war in Gaza began, but Nasrallah has appeared reluctant to escalate it further, perhaps fearing a repeat of the monthlong 2006 war, in which Israel heavily bombed Beirut and southern Lebanon.

Arouri was the deputy of Hamas’ supreme political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, and headed the group’s presence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. He was also a key liaison with Hezbollah. The US State Department had listed him as a terrorist and offered a USD 5 million reward for information about him. Haniyeh said Hamas was “more powerful and determined” following the attack, which killed six other members of the group, including two military commanders. “They left behind them strong men who will carry the banner after them,” he said of those killed. Hezbollah called the strike “a serious attack on Lebanon, its people, its security, sovereignty and resistance.” “We affirm that this crime will never pass without response and punishment,” it said.

102,How a proxy fight over campus politics brought down Harvard’s president,"Written by Nicholas Confessore The resignation of Harvard’s president, Claudine Gay, on Tuesday followed a lengthening catalogue of plagiarism allegations that appeared to steadily sap her support among the university’s faculty, students and alumni. But for many of Gay’s critics, her departure was also a proxy victory in the escalating ideological battle over American higher education. Taking down Gay was a “a huge scalp” in the “fight for civilizational sanity,” Josh Hammer, a conservative talk show host and writer, wrote on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter. Claudine Gay’s is a huge scalp. No doubt about that. Especially when combined with Liz Magill’s a few weeks ago. But we can’t rest on our laurels. This is a fight for civilizational sanity against civilizational arson. We can’t stop until the DEI cancer is fully eliminated. — Josh Hammer (@josh_hammer) January 2, 2024 “A crushing loss to D.E.I., wokeism, antisemitism & university elitism,” wrote conservative commentator Liz Wheeler, referring to diversity, equity and inclusion. “This is the beginning of the end for D.E.I. in America’s institutions,” said conservative activist Christopher Rufo, who had helped publicise the plagiarism allegations. Until last month, conservative-inspired efforts to remake higher education had unfolded primarily at public universities in right-leaning states such as Florida and Texas, where GOP lawmakers and state officials could exercise their legislative and executive powers to ban diversity offices, set up right-leaning academic centers and demand changes to curriculum. But Gay’s resignation on Tuesday secured their movement a signal victory at the country’s most storied private university, which had for weeks resisted calls for a change in leadership. An update on Harvard University leadership. https://t.co/ky4rwdwDCX — Harvard University (@Harvard) January 2, 2024 “I think there are major problems with higher education, and Harvard represents a lot of those problems,” said John D Sailer, a senior fellow at the National Association of Scholars, a conservative education nonprofit. “To the extent those problems have been exposed, and scepticism increases towards the current best instantiation of higher education, I think that puts a lot of wind in the sails of reform.” Gay’s defenders seemed to agree, warning that her resignation would encourage conservative interference in universities and imperil academic freedom (though some experts have rated Harvard itself poorly on campus free speech during Gay’s tenure in leadership). “This is a terrible moment,” said Khalil Gibran Muhammad, a professor of history, race and public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School. “Republican congressional leaders have declared war on the independence of colleges and universities, just as Gov. DeSantis has done in Florida. They will only be emboldened by Gay’s resignation.” Barely a month had passed since Gay had appeared, along with the presidents of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Pennsylvania, at a congressional hearing on campus antisemitism, where their lawyerly defense of a student’s right to engage in anti-Jewish speech provoked national outrage. Some Jewish students, faculty and donors also felt Gay had been too timid in her response to the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas, as well as to complaints over antisemitism on campus. Two of the three presidents who spoke at the hearing are now out of office. (The second of those is M Elizabeth Magill, who resigned as the University of Pennsylvania president just four days after she testified before Congress.) On Tuesday, Gay’s antagonists jockeyed for credit, sometimes hailing the effectiveness of their own political theater. Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, a Harvard-educated Republican, noted in a statement that her interrogation of Gay at last month’s hearing had “made history as the most viewed congressional testimony in the history of the US Congress.” Republican lawmakers, she promised, would “continue to move forward to expose the rot in our most ‘prestigious’ higher education institutions.” Even before the hearing, conservative activists and outlets had begun reexamining Gay’s acclaimed but relatively thin academic output, prompting further examination by mainstream news outlets. The public drumbeat began almost immediately after the hearing with a post by Rufo, who had obtained an anonymous dossier of work published by Gay in which she had allegedly plagiarised other scholars, as well as a report in the Washington Free Beacon. That outlet published a follow-up on Monday night with additional examples. All told, the plagiarism allegations spanned nearly half of her published academic articles, the report said. But along the way, Gay — a scholar of Black political participation and an architect of Harvard’s efforts to advance what she has called “racial justice” on campus — came to stand for the right’s broader critique of elite academia, which it views as intellectually narrow, lax in standards and overly focused on questions of identity. Opponents attacked Gay, who attended Princeton and Harvard before turning to an administrative career, as unqualified for the position she had assumed just six months ago, a charge her supporters rejected as racist. “It was a thinly veiled exercise in race & gender when they selected Claudine Gay,” Vivek Ramaswamy, the entrepreneur and Republican candidate for president, wrote on X on Tuesday. “Here’s a radical idea for the future: select leadership based on *merit.*” Harvard’s President Claudine Gay just resigned…better late than never. Back in 2006, I was one of 3 students appointed to the advisory board to select Harvard’s new President in 2007 after Larry Summers was forced to resign after his supposedly “misogynistic” comments (which… — Vivek Ramaswamy (@VivekGRamaswamy) January 2, 2024 Harvard announced her departure without any indication that it believed that Gay had acted improperly; Gay’s resignation letter noted that she had made her decision to step down “in consultation with members of the corporation,” but did not elaborate. Some Harvard faculty and alumni were left to conclude that the school had simply caved to public pressure from activists and powerful donors. “I am saddened by the inability of a great university to defend itself against an alarmingly effective campaign of misinformation and intimidation,” Randall Kennedy, a Harvard legal scholar and one of the university’s most prominent Black faculty members, wrote in a text message. Like other major research universities, Harvard is supported by a huge volume of federal grants and other funding, a potential pressure point for Republican lawmakers going forward. Whether the resignation of one or two college presidents will spur any broader remaking of higher education is unclear. As the COVID pandemic recedes, Republican officials and education activists have found it more difficult to interest broad swaths of voters in campaigns to restrict access to sexually explicit books, or in often-vague attacks on “wokeism” and “equity.” The two Republican presidential contenders who have campaigned most explicitly against higher education institutions — the Yale-educated Ron DeSantis and the Harvard-educated Ramaswamy — have failed to gain lasting traction in the race. Efforts to stop schools from requiring job applicants to furnish diversity statements, or commitments to particular ideas about race and justice, have attracted support beyond the political right. But more heavy-handed measures to require — or ban — the teaching of particular ideas have gained less traction, leading activists on the right to focus more on other areas, such as dismantling tenure protections and administrative programs related to DEI. “If Rufo’s goal is to enlist the public into his war on higher ed, he has yet to succeed,” said Jeffrey Sachs, a scholar at Acadia University in Nova Scotia who studies academic speech policies. “The public, including a majority of Republicans, does not want government deciding what gets taught in America’s university classroom. Nor do they warm to the idea when specific legislation is presented to them for review.”",World,proxy fight campus politics bring harvards president write nicholas confessore resignation harvards

103,"Deaths of wealthy Indian-origin couple, daughter in US ruled murder-suicide","The deaths of a wealthy Indian-origin couple and their daughter in the US state of Massachusetts last week have been ruled a murder-suicide by medical authorities after autopsy. Rakesh Kamal, 57, his wife Teena Kamal, 54 and their college-going daughter Arianna Kamal, 18 were found dead in their $5 million mansion in Dover, Massachusetts on December 28, 2023. A firearm was found near Rakesh Kamal. A press release issued by the office of Norfolk District Attorney Michael Morrissey on Tuesday said that autopsy results issued by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner confirm that Teena and her daughter Arianna were victims of homicide by gunshot. Rakesh died from a “gunshot wound consistent with being self-inflicted”. The final autopsy report is likely to be completed in the coming weeks. The release further said that while full forensic and ballistics testing of the gun has not been finalised, the firearm found with Rakesh is consistent with a .40 calibre Glock 22. However, the firearm was not registered in Rakesh’s name and “he was not licensed to possess it,” the release added. Massachusetts State Police have contacted the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives for assistance in determining the origin of the firearm. The incident remains under investigation by Dover and Massachusetts State Police. Last week, Morrissey said that the initial investigation indicated the incident was a case of domestic violence and did not initially indicate the involvement of outside parties. Dover Police received a 911 call requesting a response to the Kamal residence at approximately 7.24 pm on December 28 by a family member who had stopped by to check on the family. The police found the Kamal family dead when it arrived on the scene. Investigators had worked the crime scene through much of the night. Dover is about 32 kilometres southwest of downtown Boston, the capital of Massachusetts. Morrissey has said that there had been no prior police reports or domestic incidents tied to the home. The family’s sprawling mansion, estimated to be worth $5.45 million, went into foreclosure a year ago and was sold for $3 million, according to a report in The New York Post. The Kamals purchased the 19,000-square-foot estate, which boasts 11 bedrooms and 14 bathrooms, for $4 million in 2019, according to the records, and media reports. The slain family members were the only ones living in the mansion at the time, the DA said, adding that the area, one of the richest in the state, was a nice neighbourhood and a safe community. Teena and her husband, who also went by Rick, had previously run a now-defunct education systems company called EduNova. The couple appeared to have faced financial problems in recent years, online records show. Their company was launched in 2016 but was dissolved in December 2021, state records show. Teena was listed on EduNova’s website as the chief operating officer of the company, describing her as an alum of Harvard University and Delhi University in India. According to his biography on the EduNova website, Kamal was an alumnus of Boston University and MIT Sloan School of Management, as well as Stanford University. Before working at EduNova, he held many executive-level positions in the education-consulting field, the biography added. EduNova marketed a student success system designed to improve the grades of students in middle school, high school and college, The Boston Globe newspaper reported. Teena filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in September 2022 listing between $1 million and $10 million in liabilities, filings show. The case, however, was dismissed two months later due to insufficient documentation. She was listed as one of the board of directors for the American Red Cross of Massachusetts. Her online bio noted her more than three decades of working in the education and technology industries. Meanwhile, the couple’s daughter was a student at Middlebury College, a $64,800-a-year private liberal arts school in Vermont, where she was studying neuroscience, according to her LinkedIn profile. Morrissey also said that a homicide had not been reported in Dover since 2020, and he has never worked a homicide case from that neighbourhood since he started his position as District Attorney 12 years ago. Morrissey had said that it was very rare to have this kind of a violent situation almost in any community in Norfolk County, particularly Dover. It’s a small, well-run community, but like everybody else, there are problems out there that can affect no matter where one lives, he had said.",World,deaths wealthy indianorigin couple daughter us rule murdersuicide deaths wealthy indianorigin couple daughter us state massachusetts last week rule murdersuicide medical authorities autopsy rakesh kamal wife teena kamal collegegoing daughter arianna kamal find dead million mansion dover massachusetts december firearm find near rakesh kamal press release issue office norfolk district attorney michael morrissey tuesday say autopsy result issue office chief medical examiner confirm teena daughter arianna victims homicide gunshotrakesh die gunshot wind consistent selfinflicted final autopsy report likely complete come weeks release say full forensic ballistics test gun finalise firearm find rakesh consistent calibre glock however firearm register rakeshs name license possess release add massachusetts state police contact bureau alcohol tobacco firearms explosives assistance determine origin firearm incident remain investigation dover massachusetts state police last week morrissey say initial investigation indicate incident case domestic violence initially indicate involvement outside party dover police receive call request response kamal residence approximately pm december family member stop check family police find kamal family dead arrive scene investigators work crime scene much night dover kilometres southwest downtown boston capital massachusetts morrissey say prior police report domestic incidents tie home familys sprawl mansion estimate worth million go foreclosure year ago sell million accord report new york post kamals purchase squarefoot estate boast bedrooms bathrooms million accord record media report slay family members ones live mansion time da say add area one richest state nice neighbourhood safe community teena husband also go rick previously run nowdefunct education systems company call edunova couple appear face financial problems recent years online record show company launch dissolve december state record show teena list edunovas website chief operate officer company describe alum harvard university delhi university india accord biography edunova website kamal alumnus boston university mit sloan school management well stanford university work edunova hold many executivelevel position educationconsulting field biography add edunova market student success system design improve grade students middle school high school college boston globe newspaper report teena file chapter bankruptcy september list million million liabilities file show case however dismiss two months later due insufficient documentation list one board directors american red cross massachusetts online bio note three decades work education technology industries meanwhile couple daughter student middlebury college ayear private liberal arts school vermont study neuroscience accord linkedin profile morrissey also say homicide report dover since never work homicide case neighbourhood since start position district attorney years ago morrissey say rare kind violent situation almost community norfolk county particularly dover small wellrun community like everybody else problems affect matter one live say,3
104,‘It was a miracle’: How passengers escaped as their plane went up fireball in Japan,"The flight between the northern city of Sapporo and Tokyo’s Haneda airport is Japan’s busiest air route, and one of the most frequent services anywhere in the world. Japan Airlines (JAL) operates 16 round-trip flights a day. But when JAL516 followed that route to Haneda on Tuesday, what unfolded was a runway collision that is baffling aviation experts and a smooth evacuation and rescue that some described as miraculous. All 379 passengers and crew escaped the Airbus A350 aircraft which erupted into a fireball after colliding with a smaller Coast Guard plane shortly after landing. Five of the six Coast Guard plane crew were killed. Satoshi Yamake, 59, was returning to the capital where he works in the telecoms sector after visiting relatives in his home town. His mind drifted to the reunion with his wife Mika as the wheels skidded on the tarmac, before he was shaken by a rattling and a bang and then turned to see the engine on fire outside his window. The collision happened almost instantly after touching down at 5.46 pm (0846 GMT), the airline said. The captain had been given permission to land but likely could not see the Coast Guard’s smaller Bombardier-built Dash-8 maritime patrol plane below, airline executives said at a late night press conference. Authorities say they are investigating the circumstances behind the crash, which aviation experts say are highly unusual. Once a recurring safety problem, the aviation industry has managed to reduce drastically the number of accidents caused by runway collisions or incursions since the arrival of better ground tracking and procedures. As the passenger jet skidded to a stop, the captain of the Coast Guard plane, 39-year-old Genki Miyamoto, pulled himself from the wreckage and radioed his base. “The aircraft exploded on the runway. I escaped. The (condition of the) other crew members is unknown,” he said, according to the Coast Guard. The other five crew, aged between 27 and 56, died. The cabin of the passenger jet began quickly filling with smoke while some anxious passengers ran up and down the aisles and others clung to shrieking children. “Please get me out of here,” one woman shouted in a video shared with Reuters from inside the plane. “Why don’t you just open (the doors),” a child screamed. “I really thought I was going to die,” said Tokyo resident Tsubasa Sawada, 28, who was returning from a holiday in Sapporo with his girlfriend. “After the accident happened, I was laughing a bit at first when I could see some sparks coming out (of the engine) but when the fire started, I realised it was more than just something.” Flight attendants seemed to be urging people to remain calm, saying “please cooperate”, according to the video shared with Reuters. Outside, 115 fire-fighting units were deployed to the scene to tackle a blaze that started at the back of the plane and eventually engulfed the whole aircraft in a ball of flames. Yamake, who was seated near the front, said despite some passengers being very anxious, the crew quickly deployed the evacuation chutes and people began disembarking in an orderly fashion. The airline said the evacuation began almost immediately after the plane came to a standstill and that all passengers were taken to safety within less than 20 minutes. Video footage showed passengers being evacuated calmly, apparently without hand luggage. Aviation safety agencies have warned for years that pausing to collect carry-on baggage risks lives during an evacuation. “The cabin crew must have done an excellent job. There don’t seem to be any carry-ons. It was a miracle that all the passengers got off,” said Paul Hayes, director of air safety at UK-based aviation consultancy Ascend by Cirium. A Japanese transport ministry official said at a media briefing that the airline’s evacuation procedures were “conducted appropriately”.
Sawada said around 10 minutes after they disembarked, there was an explosion on the plane. “I can only say it was a miracle, we could have died if we were late,” he said. “I want to know why this happened and I feel like I don’t want to board a plane again.”",World,miracle passengers escape plane go fireball japan flight northern city sapporo tokyos haneda airport japan busiest air route one frequent service anywhere world japan airlines jal operate roundtrip flight day jal follow route haneda tuesday unfold runway collision baffle aviation experts smooth evacuation rescue describe miraculous passengers crew escape airbus aircraft erupt fireball collide smaller coast guard plane shortly land five six coast guard plane crew kill satoshi yamake return capital work telecoms sector visit relatives home town mind drift reunion wife mika wheel skid tarmac shake rattle bang turn see engine fire outside window collision happen almost instantly touch pm gmt airline say captain give permission land likely could see coast guard smaller bombardierbuilt dash maritime patrol plane airline executives say late night press conference authorities say investigate circumstances behind crash aviation experts say highly unusual recur safety problem aviation industry manage reduce drastically number accidents cause runway collisions incursions since arrival better grind track procedures passenger jet skid stop captain coast guard plane yearold genki miyamoto pull wreckage radio base aircraft explode runway escape condition crew members unknown say accord coast guard five crew age die cabin passenger jet begin quickly fill smoke anxious passengers run aisles others cling shriek children please get one woman shout video share reuters inside plane dont open doors child scream really think go die say tokyo resident tsubasa sawada return holiday sapporo girlfriend accident happen laugh bite first could see spark come engine fire start realise something flight attendants seem urge people remain calm say please cooperate accord video share reuters outside firefighting units deploy scene tackle blaze start back plane eventually engulf whole aircraft ball flame yamake seat near front say despite passengers anxious crew quickly deploy evacuation chute people begin disembark orderly fashion airline say evacuation begin almost immediately plane come standstill passengers take safety within less minutes video footage show passengers evacuate calmly apparently without hand luggage aviation safety agencies warn years pause collect carryon baggage risk live evacuation cabin crew must do excellent job dont seem carryons miracle passengers get say paul hay director air safety ukbased aviation consultancy ascend cirium japanese transport ministry official say media brief airlines evacuation procedures conduct appropriatelysawada say around minutes disembark explosion plane say miracle could die late say want know happen feel like dont want board plane,3
105,Powerful earthquakes in Japan leave at least 62 dead. Fears grow about saving people still trapped,"A series of powerful earthquakes that hit western Japan left at least 62 people dead Wednesday, as rescue workers fought to save those feared trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings. Aftershocks continued to shake Ishikawa prefecture and nearby areas two days after a magnitude 7.6 temblor slammed the area. The first 72 hours are considered crucial to save lives after disasters. Water, power and cell phone service were still down in some areas. Residents expressed sorrow about their uncertain futures.”It’s not just that it’s a mess. The wall has collapsed, and you can see through to the next room. I don’t think we can live here anymore,” Miki Kobayashi, an Ishikawa resident, said as she swept around her house.The house was also damaged in a 2007 quake, she said.Of the deaths, 29 were counted in Wajima city, while 22 people died in Suzu, according to Ishikawa Prefectural authorities. Dozens of people have been seriously injured, including in nearby prefectures. Although casualty numbers continued to climb gradually, the prompt public warnings, relayed on broadcasts and phones, and the quick response from the general public and officials appeared to have limited some of the damage. Toshitaka Katada, a University of Tokyo professor specializing in disasters, said people were prepared because the area had been hit by quakes in recent years. They had evacuation plans and emergency supplies in stock. “There are probably no people on Earth who are as disaster-ready as the Japanese,” he told The Associated Press.Japan is frequently hit by earthquakes because of its location along the “Ring of Fire,” an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin. Katada warned the situation remains precarious and unpredictable. The March 2011 quake and tsunami in northeastern Japan had been preceded by other quakes.“This is far from over,” Katada said. Predictions by scientists have repeatedly been proven wrong, such as with the 2016 quake in southwestern Kumamoto, an area previously seen as relatively quake-free.“Having too much confidence in the power of science is very dangerous. We are dealing with nature,” Katada said. Japanese media’s aerial footage showed widespread damage in the hardest-hit spots, with landslides burying roads, boats tossed in the waters and a fire that had turned an entire section of Wajima city to ashes. Japan’s military has dispatched 1,000 soldiers to the disaster zones to join rescue efforts. It was uncertain how many more victims might still be in the rubble. Nuclear regulators said several nuclear plants in the region were operating normally. A major quake and tsunami in 2011 caused three reactors to melt and release large amounts of radiation at a nuclear plant in northeastern Japan. On Monday, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued a major tsunami warning for Ishikawa and lower-level tsunami warnings or advisories for the rest of the western coast of Japan’s main island of Honshu, as well as for the northern island of Hokkaido. The warning was downgraded several hours later, and all tsunami warnings were lifted as of early Tuesday. Waves measuring more than one meter (3 feet) hit some places.Still, half-sunken ships floated in bays where tsunami waves had rolled in, leaving a muddied coastline.People who were evacuated from their houses huddled in auditoriums, schools and community centers. Bullet trains in the region were halted, but service was mostly restored. Sections of highways were closed.Weather forecasters predicted rain, setting off worries about crumbling buildings and infrastructure. The region includes tourist spots famous for lacquerware and other traditional crafts, along with designated cultural heritage sites. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese joined President Joe Biden and other world leaders in expressing support for the Japanese. “Our hearts go out to our friends in Japan,” he said. “We will provide, and have offered, whatever support is requested by our friends in Japan.”",World,powerful earthquakes japan leave least dead fear grow save people still trap series powerful earthquakes hit western japan leave least people dead wednesday rescue workers fight save fear trap rubble collapse build aftershocks continue shake ishikawa prefecture nearby areas two days magnitude temblor slam area first hours consider crucial save live disasters water power cell phone service still areas residents express sorrow uncertain futuresits mess wall collapse see next room dont think live anymore miki kobayashi ishikawa resident say sweep around housethe house also damage quake saidof deaths count wajima city people die suzu accord ishikawa prefectural authorities dozens people seriously injure include nearby prefectures although casualty number continue climb gradually prompt public warn relay broadcast phone quick response general public officials appear limit damage toshitaka katada university tokyo professor specialize disasters say people prepare area hit quake recent years evacuation plan emergency supply stock probably people earth disasterready japanese tell associate pressjapan frequently hit earthquakes location along ring fire arc volcanoes fault line pacific basin katada warn situation remain precarious unpredictable march quake tsunami northeastern japan precede quakesthis far katada say predictions scientists repeatedly prove wrong quake southwestern kumamoto area previously see relatively quakefreehaving much confidence power science dangerous deal nature katada say japanese medias aerial footage show widespread damage hardesthit spot landslides bury roads boat toss water fire turn entire section wajima city ash japan military dispatch soldier disaster zone join rescue efforts uncertain many victims might still rubble nuclear regulators say several nuclear plant region operate normally major quake tsunami cause three reactors melt release large amount radiation nuclear plant northeastern japan monday japan meteorological agency issue major tsunami warn ishikawa lowerlevel tsunami warn advisories rest western coast japan main island honshu well northern island hokkaido warn downgrade several hours later tsunami warn lift early tuesday wave measure one meter feet hit placesstill halfsunken ship float bay tsunami wave roll leave muddy coastlinepeople evacuate house huddle auditoriums school community center bullet train region halt service mostly restore section highways closedweather forecasters predict rain set worry crumble build infrastructure region include tourist spot famous lacquerware traditional craft along designate cultural heritage sit australian prime minister anthony albanese join president joe biden world leaders express support japanese hearts go friends japan say provide offer whatever support request friends japan,3
106,"Harvard president Claudine Gay resigns amid plagiarism claims, backlash from antisemitism testimony","Harvard University President Claudine Gay resigned on Tuesday amid plagiarism accusations and criticism over testimony at a congressional hearing where she was unable to say unequivocally that calls on campus for the genocide of Jews would violate the school’s conduct policy. Gay is the second Ivy League president to resign in the past month following the congressional testimony — Liz Magill, president of the University of Pennsylvania, resigned on December 9. Gay, Harvard’s first Black president, announced her departure just months into her tenure in a letter to the Harvard community. Following the congressional hearing, Gay’s academic career came under intense scrutiny by conservative activists who unearthed several instances of alleged plagiarism in her 1997 doctoral dissertation. The Harvard Corporation, Harvard’s governing board, initially rallied behind Gay, saying a review of her scholarly work turned up “a few instances of inadequate citation” but no evidence of research misconduct. Days later, the Harvard Corporation said it found two additional examples of “duplicative language without appropriate attribution”. The board said Gay would update her dissertation and request corrections. The Harvard Corporation said the resignation came “with great sadness” and thanked Gay for her “deep and unwavering commitment to Harvard and to the pursuit of academic excellence”. Alan M Garber, provost and chief academic officer, will serve as interim president until Harvard finds a replacement, the board said in a statement. Garber, an economist and physician, has served as provost for 12 years. Gay’s resignation was celebrated by the conservatives who put her alleged plagiarism in the national spotlight — with additional plagiarism accusations surfacing as recently as Monday in “The Washington Free Beacon”, a conservative publication. Christopher Rufo, an activist who has helped rally the GOP against higher education, said he is “glad she is gone”. “Rather than take responsibility for minimising antisemitism, committing serial plagiarism, intimidating the free press, and damaging the institution, she calls her critics racist,” Rufo said on X, formerly Twitter. “This is the poison” of diversity, equity and inclusion ideology, said Rufo, who has led conservative attacks on DEI both in business and in education. Gay, in her letter, said it has been “distressing to have doubt cast on my commitments to confronting hate and to upholding scholarly rigour — two bedrock values that are fundamental to who I am — and frightening to be subjected to personal attacks and threats fuelled by racial animus”. But Gay, who is returning to the school’s faculty, added “it has become clear that it is in the best interests of Harvard for me to resign so that our community can navigate this moment of extraordinary challenge”. Yoel Zimmermann, a visiting research undergrad from Munich, Germany, studying physics at Harvard, said that as a Jewish student, he has noticed fellow members of the Jewish community have felt uncomfortable with the climate on campus. “I think it was about time that Claudine Gay resigned,” Zimmerman said. “She just did too many things wrong, especially with her testimony in Congress. I think that was just the kind of final tipping point that should have led to her removal immediately.” Supporters of Gay lamented her resignation. “Racist mobs won’t stop until they topple all Black people from positions of power and influence who are not reinforcing the structure of racism,” award-winning author Ibram X Kendi, who survived scrutiny of an antiracist research centre he founded at Boston University, said in an Instagram post. The Rev. Al Sharpton in a statement called pressure for Gay to resign “an attack on every Black woman in this country who’s put a crack in the glass ceiling” and an “assault on the health, strength, and future of diversity, equity, and inclusion”.
Critics welcomed her decision. House Committee on Education and the Workforce Chairwoman Rep. Virginia Foxx called Gay’s resignation welcome news but said the problems at Harvard are much larger than one leader. “Postsecondary education is in a tailspin,” the North Carolina Republican said in a statement. “There has been a hostile takeover of postsecondary education by political activists, woke faculty, and partisan administrators.” Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, in a statement on X, also weighed in on Gay’s resignation. “A little context. A failure in leadership and denial of antisemitism have a price. I hope that the esteemed Harvard University will learn from this dismal conduct,” he wrote. Gay, Magill and MIT’s president, Sally Kornbluth, came under fire last month for their lawyerly answers to a line of questioning from New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, who asked whether “calling for the genocide of Jews” would violate the colleges’ codes of conduct. The three presidents had been called before the Republican-led House Committee on Education and the Workforce to answer accusations that universities were failing to protect Jewish students amid rising fears of antisemitism worldwide and fallout from Israel’s intensifying war in Gaza, which faces heightened criticism for the mounting Palestinian death toll. Gay said it depended on the context, adding that when “speech crosses into conduct, that violates our policies”. The answer faced swift backlash from Republican and some Democratic lawmakers as well as the White House.",World,harvard president claudine gay resign amid plagiarism claim backlash antisemitism testimony harvard university president claudine gay resign tuesday amid plagiarism accusations criticism testimony congressional hear unable say unequivocally call campus genocide jews would violate school conduct policy gay second ivy league president resign past month follow congressional testimony liz magill president university pennsylvania resign december gay harvards first black president announce departure months tenure letter harvard community follow congressional hear gays academic career come intense scrutiny conservative activists unearth several instance allege plagiarism doctoral dissertation harvard corporation harvards govern board initially rally behind gay say review scholarly work turn instance inadequate citation evidence research misconduct days later harvard corporation say find two additional examples duplicative language without appropriate attribution board say gay would update dissertation request corrections harvard corporation say resignation come great sadness thank gay deep unwavering commitment harvard pursuit academic excellence alan garber provost chief academic officer serve interim president harvard find replacement board say statement garber economist physician serve provost years gays resignation celebrate conservatives put allege plagiarism national spotlight additional plagiarism accusations surface recently monday washington free beacon conservative publication christopher rufo activist help rally gop higher education say glad go rather take responsibility minimise antisemitism commit serial plagiarism intimidate free press damage institution call critics racist rufo say x formerly twitter poison diversity equity inclusion ideology say rufo lead conservative attack dei business education gay letter say distress doubt cast commitments confront hate uphold scholarly rigour two bedrock value fundamental frighten subject personal attack threats fuel racial animus gay return school faculty add become clear best interest harvard resign community navigate moment extraordinary challenge yoel zimmermann visit research undergrad munich germany study physics harvard say jewish student notice fellow members jewish community felt uncomfortable climate campus think time claudine gay resign zimmerman say many things wrong especially testimony congress think kind final tip point lead removal immediately supporters gay lament resignation racist mob wont stop topple black people position power influence reinforce structure racism awardwinning author ibram x kendi survive scrutiny antiracist research centre found boston university say instagram post rev al sharpton statement call pressure gay resign attack every black woman country whos put crack glass ceiling assault health strength future diversity equity inclusioncritics welcome decision house committee education workforce chairwoman rep virginia foxx call gays resignation welcome news say problems harvard much larger one leader postsecondary education tailspin north carolina republican say statement hostile takeover postsecondary education political activists wake faculty partisan administrators israeli foreign minister israel katz statement x also weigh gays resignation little context failure leadership denial antisemitism price hope esteem harvard university learn dismal conduct write gay magill mits president sally kornbluth come fire last month lawyerly answer line question new york rep elise stefanik ask whether call genocide jews would violate colleges cod conduct three presidents call republicanled house committee education workforce answer accusations universities fail protect jewish students amid rise fear antisemitism worldwide fallout israels intensify war gaza face heighten criticism mount palestinian death toll gay say depend context add speech cross conduct violate policies answer face swift backlash republican democratic lawmakers well white house,3
107,Hezbollah’s TV station says top Hamas official Saleh Arouri killed in Beirut blast,"The TV station of Lebanon’s Hezbollah group says top Hamas official Saleh Arouri was killed on Tuesday in an explosion in a southern Beirut suburb. Arouri, one of the founders of Hamas’ military wing, had headed the group’s presence in the West Bank. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had threatened to kill him even before the Hamas-Israel war began on October 7. Israeli officials declined to comment. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said the blast killed four people and was carried out by an Israeli drone. An explosion shook the Lebanese capital’s southern suburbs Tuesday evening causing chaos in the militant Hezbollah group’s stronghold, but the nature of the blast was not immediately known. It wasn’t clear if the explosion inflicted any casualties in the Beirut suburb but videos circulating on social media showed serious damage and fire.

108,Israel says will defend itself against genocide accusations at world court,"Israel says it will defend itself against genocide accusations filed by South Africa with the world court. Eylon Levy, an official in the Israeli prime minister’s office, on Tuesday accused South Africa of “giving political and legal cover” to Hamas’ October 7 attack that triggered Israel’s war against the militant group. “The state of Israel will appear before the International Court of Justice at the Hague to dispel South Africa’s absurd blood libel,” Levy said. South Africa launched the case Friday at the U.N.’s top court, accusing Israel of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and asking the court to order Israel to halt its attacks. Israel dismisses international cases against it as unfair and biased and rarely cooperates.

109,Japan Airlines plane-Coast Guard aircraft collision: What we know so far,"A passenger plane collided with a Japanese coast guard aircraft and burst into flames on the runway of Tokyo’s Haneda Airport on Tuesday. All 379 passengers and crew of the Japan Airlines plane miraculously escaped the blaze, while casualties were reported in the coast guard aircraft. Live footage on public broadcaster NHK showed the Japan Airlines (JAL) Airbus A350 aircraft (JAL-516) bursting into flames as it skidded down the tarmac at around 6 p.m. (0900 GMT). It had flown out of Shin Chitose airport in Japan to Haneda when the incident happened. As it taxied on a runway, videos showed a large eruption of fire and smoke from the side of the plane. Shortly the area around the wing caught fire, and then the plane entirely was engulfed in fire.

110,Rishi Sunak declares success in meeting UK’s asylum target,"British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Tuesday declared he had met his target to clear the country’s “legacy” asylum backlog by the end of 2023 and also bucked the trend across Europe by cutting down arrivals of illegal migrants via small boats by 36 per cent. The UK Home Office said that 112,000 asylum cases were processed in the past year, which exceeded Sunak’s initial target of 92,000 applications pending at the end of 2022. It claimed that fundamental changes to the decision-making process and boosting efficiency resulted in the highest annual number of “substantive” asylum decisions in a year since 2002. “I am determined to end the burden of illegal migration on the British people. That is why we have taken action to stop the boats, return hotels to their local communities, and deter those wanting to come here illegally from doing so,” said Sunak in a statement to mark the start of 2024, a general election year for the UK. I said that this government would clear the backlog of asylum decisions by the end of 2023. That’s exactly what we’ve done. Over 112,000 cases are now cleared with a lower grant rate than last year, a key part of our plan to stop the boats. — Rishi Sunak (@RishiSunak) January 2, 2024 “By clearing the legacy asylum backlog, deciding more than 112,000 cases, we are saving the taxpayer millions of pounds in expensive hotel costs, reducing strain on public services and ensuring the most vulnerable receive the right support. But we cannot be complacent, which is why I am focused on delivering on my commitment to stop the boats and get flights off the ground to Rwanda,” he said. The Rwanda plan involves asylum seekers being flown out to the east African country while their applications are processed, with the controversial measure to go through its parliamentary process in the coming weeks. “While illegal entries across Europe are going up, the number of people coming into the UK illegally is going down. This is a significant achievement, but the job is far from over,” said UK Home Secretary James Cleverly. “I will continue to do everything possible to stop the boats. No people smuggler will be safe, we will work with law enforcement partners and Governments across the world who want to tackle this threat and ensure that British taxpayer money is not wasted on people trying to abuse our generosity,” he said. The UK government claims it stepped up processing, deploying an additional 1,200 caseworkers, meeting the target to double the number of asylum caseworkers and tripling productivity to ensure more illegal migrants are returned to their country of origin, quicker. All cases in the so-called “legacy backlog” have now reportedly been reviewed, with 86,800 decisions made. In one four-week period from November 20 to December 17, 2023, there were 20,481 initial asylum decisions made, this is more than the number of asylum decisions made in the entirety of 2021. However, the Opposition Labour Party hit back at these claims to accuse the government of “misleading” the public. “The asylum backlog has rocketed to 165,000 under the Tories – eight times higher than when Labour left office – and no slicing or renaming the figures can disguise that fact,” said Labour’s shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock. However, the Home Office insisted all cases have been reviewed and 112,000 decisions made overall, with 4,500 “complex cases” highlighted that require additional checks or investigation for a final decision to be made. The Home Office said: “These hard cases typically relate to asylum seekers presenting as children – where age verification is taking place; those with serious medical issues; or those with suspected past convictions, where checks may reveal criminality that would bar asylum. “The robust action taken by the government to disrupt and deter small boat gangs and people smugglers has seen the UK defy trends across Europe, and large parts of the world, by having fewer small boat arrivals than the previous year, while sea crossings to Europe are up 80 per cent. As well as individuals arriving by small boats dropping by 36 per cent, there has also been a 46 per cent decrease in the number of vessels, crossing the [English] Channel, demonstrating the success of operations to disrupt the supply of boats and engines.” Sunak sees curbing soaring migration figures, both legal and illegal, an important target for the government as he prepares for a general election this year. The Home Office has claimed many successes in this area in 2023, including returning more than 24,000 people who had no right to be in the UK, 5,576 arrests over illegal working, overstaying, facilitating illegal entry and entering illegally, 68 per cent increase in illegal working clampdowns and 246 arrests of people smugglers.",World,rishi sunak declare success meet uks asylum target british prime minister rishi sunak tuesday declare meet target clear countrys legacy asylum backlog end also buck trend across europe cut arrivals illegal migrants via small boat per cent uk home office say asylum case process past year exceed sunaks initial target applications pending end claim fundamental change decisionmaking process boost efficiency result highest annual number substantive asylum decisions year since determine end burden illegal migration british people take action stop boat return hotels local communities deter want come illegally say sunak statement mark start general election year uk say government would clear backlog asylum decisions end thats exactly weve do case clear lower grant rate last year key part plan stop boat rishi sunak january clear legacy asylum backlog decide case save taxpayer millions pound expensive hotel cost reduce strain public service ensure vulnerable receive right support cannot complacent focus deliver commitment stop boat get flight grind rwanda say rwanda plan involve asylum seekers fly east african country applications process controversial measure go parliamentary process come weeks illegal entries across europe go number people come uk illegally go significant achievement job far say uk home secretary jam cleverly continue everything possible stop boat people smuggler safe work law enforcement partner governments across world want tackle threat ensure british taxpayer money waste people try abuse generosity say uk government claim step process deploy additional caseworkers meet target double number asylum caseworkers triple productivity ensure illegal migrants return country origin quicker case socalled legacy backlog reportedly review decisions make one fourweek period november december initial asylum decisions make number asylum decisions make entirety however opposition labour party hit back claim accuse government mislead public asylum backlog rocket tories eight time higher labour leave office slice rename figure disguise fact say labour shadow immigration minister stephen kinnock however home office insist case review decisions make overall complex case highlight require additional check investigation final decision make home office say hard case typically relate asylum seekers present children age verification take place serious medical issue suspect past convictions check may reveal criminality would bar asylum robust action take government disrupt deter small boat gang people smugglers see uk defy trend across europe large part world fewer small boat arrivals previous year sea cross europe per cent well individuals arrive small boat drop per cent also per cent decrease number vessels cross english channel demonstrate success operations disrupt supply boat engines sunak see curb soar migration figure legal illegal important target government prepare general election year home office claim many successes area include return people right uk arrest illegal work overstay facilitate illegal entry enter illegally per cent increase illegal work clampdowns arrest people smugglers,3

112,Fighting between Hamas and Israel rages on despite partial troop withdrawal,"Israel said on Tuesday its troops had killed dozens of militants in the north of the Gaza Strip in the past day, while its aircraft and tanks stepped up strikes in the south of the Palestinian enclave. Residents said heavy fighting was also raging in central areas, citing shelling by Israeli tanks of parts of the Al-Bureij refugee camp. The actions took place after Israel announced plans to pull back some troops, signalling a new phase in the nearly three-month-long war against Hamas amid global concern over the plight of Gaza residents. Israeli bombardments have reduced much of the territory to rubble, killed nearly 22,000 Palestinians, and engulfed its 2.3 million residents in a humanitarian disaster. Israeli officials say the offensive has many months to run. In its daily briefing, the Israeli military said that in the past day its forces had targeted militants in Gaza City in the north of the enclave and in unspecified locations along the Mediterranean coast. “In Jabaliya area, troops killed dozens of terrorists, among them those who attempted to plant explosive devices, others who operated drones and those who were armed identified driving toward the forces,” the military said. Troops also seized weapons and dismantled rocket launchers in Khan Younis in the south and in a United Nations school in Al-Bureij, Israel’s military said. Gaza residents said Israeli war planes and tanks stepped up bombardments of the eastern and northern areas of Khan Younis, where tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians have sought refuge after being forced from their homes elsewhere in the densely-populated territory. In another sign of the war spreading beyond Gaza’s borders, Israeli soldiers mounting a raid in the occupied West Bank killed four armed militants who had fired at them from a house in the Palestinian village of Azzun, the military said. An Israeli official said the situation on the border with Lebanon, where Israeli forces and Lebanese Hezbollah fighters have exchanged artillery fire almost daily, would not be allowed to continue. “This coming six-month period is a critical moment,” the official said. At a house in the centre of Khan Younis, medical teams retrieved the bodies of two women killed in an Israeli air strike on Tuesday morning, health officials said. Hamas and Islamic Jihad said in separate statements they had fired mortar bombs and anti-tank rockets against Israeli forces in Khan Younis and were stopping them advancing to the western area. Tanks have been stationed east, north and at the centre. Hamas’ armed wing on Monday claimed to have killed 15 Israeli soldiers after triggering an explosive minefield east of the Tuffah neighbourhood in Gaza City. Hamas also showed its continued ability to target Israel after more than 12 weeks of the war, firing rockets at Tel Aviv. New phase The Gaza war was triggered by a surprise Hamas attack on Israeli towns on Oct. 7 that Israel says killed 1,200 people. Palestinian health authorities in Hamas-run Gaza say Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 21,978 people, making it the bloodiest episode in the decades-long wider Israel-Palestinian conflict. Israel has promised to wipe out its Hamas foes but it is unclear what it plans to do with the enclave should it succeed in subduing it, and where that leaves the prospect of an independent Palestinian state. It has signalled a new phase in its offensive, with the Israeli official saying on Monday the military would reduce its forces inside Gaza this month and shift to a months-long phase of more localised “mopping up” operations. The troop reduction would allow some reservists to return to civilian life, shore up Israel’s war-battered economy, and free up units in case of a wider conflict with the Iran-backed Hezbollah, the official said. A U.S. official said the decision appeared to indicate the start of a shift to lower-intensity operations in the north of Gaza. Washington has been urging Israel to reduce the intensity of its military operation. But Avi Dichter, a member of Israel’s security cabinet, said on Kan Radio: “Without Hamas’ terrorist infrastructure being destroyed and its governance capabilities toppled, the war will not end.” Another prime concern for Israel is the return or rescue of hostages held by Hamas. The militants seized 240 hostages on Oct. 7 and Israel believes 129 are still held after some were released during a brief truce and others killed during air strikes and rescue or escape attempts. Qatar and Egypt are seeking to negotiate a new truce and hostages deal. Residents of Sheikh Radwan district in Gaza City, which the Israeli offensive first focused on, said tanks had withdrawn after what they described as the most intense 10 days of warfare since the conflict began. “The tanks were very near. We could see them outside the houses. We couldn’t get out to fill water,” said Nasser, a father of seven living in Sheikh Radwan. Tanks also pulled out of Gaza City’s al-Mina district and parts of Tel al-Hawa district, while retaining some positions in the suburb controlling the enclave’s main coastal road, residents said.",World,fight hamas israel rag despite partial troop withdrawal israel say tuesday troop kill dozens militants north gaza strip past day aircraft tank step strike south palestinian enclave residents say heavy fight also rag central areas cite shell israeli tank part albureij refugee camp action take place israel announce plan pull back troop signal new phase nearly threemonthlong war hamas amid global concern plight gaza residents israeli bombardments reduce much territory rubble kill nearly palestinians engulf million residents humanitarian disaster israeli officials say offensive many months run daily brief israeli military say past day force target militants gaza city north enclave unspecified locations along mediterranean coast jabaliya area troop kill dozens terrorists among attempt plant explosive devices others operate drone arm identify drive toward force military say troop also seize weapons dismantle rocket launchers khan younis south unite nations school albureij israels military say gaza residents say israeli war plan tank step bombardments eastern northern areas khan younis tens thousands displace palestinians seek refuge force home elsewhere denselypopulated territory another sign war spread beyond gazas border israeli soldier mount raid occupy west bank kill four arm militants fire house palestinian village azzun military say israeli official say situation border lebanon israeli force lebanese hezbollah fighters exchange artillery fire almost daily would allow continue come sixmonth period critical moment official say house centre khan younis medical team retrieve body two women kill israeli air strike tuesday morning health officials say hamas islamic jihad say separate statements fire mortar bomb antitank rocket israeli force khan younis stop advance western area tank station east north centre hamas arm wing monday claim kill israeli soldier trigger explosive minefield east tuffah neighbourhood gaza city hamas also show continue ability target israel weeks war fire rocket tel aviv new phase gaza war trigger surprise hamas attack israeli towns oct israel say kill people palestinian health authorities hamasrun gaza say israels retaliatory offensive kill people make bloodiest episode decadeslong wider israelpalestinian conflict israel promise wipe hamas foes unclear plan enclave succeed subdue leave prospect independent palestinian state signal new phase offensive israeli official say monday military would reduce force inside gaza month shift monthslong phase localise mop operations troop reduction would allow reservists return civilian life shore israels warbattered economy free units case wider conflict iranbacked hezbollah official say us official say decision appear indicate start shift lowerintensity operations north gaza washington urge israel reduce intensity military operation avi dichter member israels security cabinet say kan radio without hamas terrorist infrastructure destroy governance capabilities topple war end another prime concern israel return rescue hostages hold hamas militants seize hostages oct israel believe still hold release brief truce others kill air strike rescue escape attempt qatar egypt seek negotiate new truce hostages deal residents sheikh radwan district gaza city israeli offensive first focus say tank withdraw describe intense days warfare since conflict begin tank near could see outside house couldnt get fill water say nasser father seven live sheikh radwan tank also pull gaza citys almina district part tel alhawa district retain position suburb control enclaves main coastal road residents say,3

A coast guard spokesperson earlier said five of the crew were unaccounted for but that the captain had escaped. Live footage on public broadcaster NHK showed the Japan Airlines (JAL) Airbus A350 aircraft bursting into flames as it skidded down the tarmac at around 6 p.m. (0900 GMT). It was later overwhelmed by the blaze despite feverish efforts by rescue crews to control the fire. But not before all 367 passengers and 12 crew were evacuated. Footage and images shared on social media showed passengers shouting inside the smoke-filled cabin and running across the tarmac away from an evacuation slide. “I felt a boom like we had hit something and jerked upward the moment we landed,” a passenger on the JAL flight told Kyodo news agency. “I saw sparks outside the window and the cabin filled with gas and smoke.” A spokesperson at Japan Airlines said its aircraft had departed from Shin-Chitose airport on the mountainous northern island of Hokkaido. The collision occurred shortly after landing. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida instructed relevant agencies to coordinate to assess the damage swiftly and provide information to the public, according to his office. Haneda, one of Tokyo’s two main airports, has closed all runways following the incident, a spokesperson said. Kaoru Ishii, a mother who was waiting outside the arrival gate for her 29-year-old daughter and boyfriend coming back on the flight said she initially though the flight was delayed until her daughter called to explain. “She said the plane had caught fire and she exited via a slide,” Ishii said. “I was really relieved that she was alright.”",World,passengers crew escape blaze japan airlines plane collision tokyo airport passengers crew japan airlines plane miraculously escape fire follow collision coast guard aircraft tokyos haneda airport tuesday local media say coast guard plane crew die coast guard say collision involve one plan head niigata airport japan west coast deliver aid catch powerful earthquake strike new years day kill least people break japan airlines plane people board collide coast guard plane tokyo airport pictwittercomanhexfcny bno news january five six crew coast guard aircraft die public broadcaster nhk report coast guard spokesperson earlier say five crew unaccounted captain escape live footage public broadcaster nhk show japan airlines jal airbus aircraft burst flame skid tarmac around pm gmt later overwhelm blaze despite feverish efforts rescue crew control fire passengers crew evacuate footage image share social media show passengers shout inside smokefilled cabin run across tarmac away evacuation slide felt boom like hit something jerk upward moment land passenger jal flight tell kyodo news agency saw spark outside window cabin fill gas smoke spokesperson japan airlines say aircraft depart shinchitose airport mountainous northern island hokkaido collision occur shortly land japanese prime minister fumio kishida instruct relevant agencies coordinate assess damage swiftly provide information public accord office haneda one tokyos two main airports close runways follow incident spokesperson say kaoru ishii mother wait outside arrival gate yearold daughter boyfriend come back flight say initially though flight delay daughter call explain say plane catch fire exit via slide ishii say really relieve alright,3
114,"In this small town, a new way of caring for older people is bringing hope","Written by Megan Specia For 12 years after her husband died, Norma Fitzgerald tried to maintain her independence, living alone in an apartment on the outskirts of Hull, in northern England, despite her mobility worsening as she reached her mid-80s. Then one day in the spring of 2022, she suddenly grew dizzy. Her legs gave out, and she collapsed on her apartment floor, unable to find the strength to get up. She lay there for two days. Eventually, a neighbour realised she hadn’t seen her for some time and called an ambulance. “They had to force the door open,” Fitzgerald, who is now 87, recalled. She was severely dehydrated and spent the next five days in a hospital. As Britain’s population ages, with almost 19% of the population older than 65, according to the 2021 census, up from 16% a decade before, the needs of an increasingly frail older population are weighing on the country’s health care system. Along with the National Health Service, many older people also rely on what is known as social care, a mosaic of private and public support that is plagued by chronic staffing shortages, a lack of nursing-home beds and slashed local budgets. The lack of easily accessible social care, which encompasses everything from home health aides who help with washing and dressing to full-time residential care, means that falls or treatable health conditions can lead to extended hospital stays. That is piling pressure on the NHS, when earlier intervention or home support would have been more appropriate. But what happened to Fitzgerald after she was discharged from the hospital is an example of an approach that could transform the way that older adults living with complex health conditions are cared for, experts say. In the past, she would probably have been sent home with little continuing care aside from her family doctor. Or she might have had to move into full-time residential care, losing her independence. Instead, she was referred to the Jean Bishop Integrated Care Center in Hull, a facility that opened five years ago as a one-stop shop for frail older people. The first of its kind in Britain, it brings together doctors, physical therapists, social workers and other professionals under one roof. In the course of a few hours, a patient can see a number of clinicians and have diagnostic tests if needed, including X-rays and blood tests, and receive a personalised care plan — all free of charge. On a sunny morning in June, Fitzgerald sat knitting a red-and-gray blanket in the center’s bright and cheerful waiting room. She had been brought by ambulance — all patients are offered transportation if needed — from her assisted-living apartment, to see a doctor specializing in geriatric care, a pharmacist, an occupational therapist and a social worker. Many geriatric health experts believe this kind of “integrated care,” with a multidisciplinary team addressing all the issues that can affect well-being, from loneliness to immobility, is the future for older people with complex health needs in Britain. Dr. Dan Harman, a geriatrician and one of the center’s clinical leads, sees his job as trying to prevent crisis rather than simply reacting to it, as in Fitzgerald’s case. The center contributed to a 13.6% reduction in emergency room visits and hospital admissions among people older than 80 and a 17.6% drop in ER visits by patients in care homes in the area between 2019 and 2022, according to NHS data. In the long run, that could lead to substantial savings for the health service and local government, while allowing patients more control over their care. Integrated services such as this are still rare in Britain, where the social care system is under extraordinary strain. After the 2008 financial crisis, the Conservative-led government oversaw a period of prolonged austerity in which local governments cut spending on social care sharply, leading to a rise in hospital admissions of people older than 65. The pandemic, and recent high inflation, intensified the pressure. Unlike the NHS, social care in England, Northern Ireland and Wales is not free for most people and is often hard to navigate (in Scotland it is free for all.) Anyone in England with assets over 23,250 pounds, or about $29,000, must pay for social care themselves or rely on help from family or charities. Many older people say they worry about steep out-of-pocket costs. The crisis in the sector is not new. In 2011, a government-commissioned independent review, led by economist Andrew Dilnot, declared the system was “not fit for purpose” and urgently in need an overhaul. More than a decade on, the report’s recommendations have gone unheeded, Dilnot said in a recent interview with The New York Times. For now, charities such as Age UK, a British organisation for older adults that has local affiliates across the country, often step in to fill the gaps. The charity offers services from advice phone lines to home cleaning to community meetups. It also has a befriending service that matches older people with volunteers who visit them weekly. In October, the lawmaker responsible for social care, Helen Whately, praised the Jean Bishop center and said that the NHS and Age UK were looking at ways to roll out its integrated care model more broadly. “The future of health care is as much about what happens out of the hospital, as what happens in it,” Whately said. For many seeking care, and for their loved ones, including Emma Gawthorpe, 46, the priority is the present. Her father, Alan Gawthorpe, 72, was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s two years ago. As they waited for his appointments at the Jean Bishop center, she told the Times that the service had made a significant difference after they had struggled to get help in the early months after his diagnosis. “It was a lot of jumping through a lot of hoops, and you need to be really firm sometimes,” Emma Gawthorpe said. “And unless it’s happening to you, you don’t know anything about it.”",World,small town new way care older people bring hope write megan specia years husband die norma fitzgerald try maintain independence live alone apartment outskirts hull northern england despite mobility worsen reach mids one day spring suddenly grow dizzy legs give collapse apartment floor unable find strength get lay two days eventually neighbour realise hadnt see time call ambulance force door open fitzgerald recall severely dehydrate spend next five days hospital britains population age almost population older accord census decade need increasingly frail older population weigh countrys health care system along national health service many older people also rely know social care mosaic private public support plague chronic staff shortages lack nursinghome bed slash local budget lack easily accessible social care encompass everything home health aid help wash dress fulltime residential care mean fall treatable health condition lead extend hospital stay pile pressure nhs earlier intervention home support would appropriate happen fitzgerald discharge hospital example approach could transform way older adults live complex health condition care experts say past would probably send home little continue care aside family doctor might move fulltime residential care lose independence instead refer jean bishop integrate care center hull facility open five years ago onestop shop frail older people first kind britain bring together doctor physical therapists social workers professionals one roof course hours patient see number clinicians diagnostic test need include xrays blood test receive personalise care plan free charge sunny morning june fitzgerald sit knit redandgray blanket center bright cheerful wait room bring ambulance patients offer transportation need assistedliving apartment see doctor specialize geriatric care pharmacist occupational therapist social worker many geriatric health experts believe kind integrate care multidisciplinary team address issue affect wellbeing loneliness immobility future older people complex health need britain dr dan harman geriatrician one center clinical lead see job try prevent crisis rather simply react fitzgeralds case center contribute reduction emergency room visit hospital admissions among people older drop er visit patients care home area accord nhs data long run could lead substantial save health service local government allow patients control care integrate service still rare britain social care system extraordinary strain financial crisis conservativeled government oversee period prolong austerity local governments cut spend social care sharply lead rise hospital admissions people older pandemic recent high inflation intensify pressure unlike nhs social care england northern ireland wales free people often hard navigate scotland free anyone england assets pound must pay social care rely help family charities many older people say worry steep outofpocket cost crisis sector new governmentcommissioned independent review lead economist andrew dilnot declare system fit purpose urgently need overhaul decade report recommendations go unheeded dilnot say recent interview new york time charities age uk british organisation older adults local affiliate across country often step fill gap charity offer service advice phone line home clean community meetups also befriend service match older people volunteer visit weekly october lawmaker responsible social care helen whately praise jean bishop center say nhs age uk look ways roll integrate care model broadly future health care much happen hospital happen whately say many seek care love ones include emma gawthorpe priority present father alan gawthorpe diagnose alzheimers two years ago wait appointments jean bishop center tell time service make significant difference struggle get help early months diagnosis lot jump lot hoop need really firm sometimes emma gawthorpe say unless happen dont know anything,3

The 7.6 magnitude earthquake hit central Japan in the middle of the afternoon on New Year’s Day, prompting tsunami alerts that forced thousands to evacuate their homes and flee to higher ground.

The couple started dating in 2012 and got secretly engaged in 2015. They have been married for over five years now, and in a recent interview, Deepika once again shared that she is looking forward to having a child with Ranveer one day. Deepika opened up about having children in a new interview, and spoke about the values she wants her children to imbibe from her. Indian Express Entertainment is now on WhatsApp Channels. Follow us for the latest news, interviews, reviews, photos and more. “Ranveer and I love children. We look forward to the day when we will start our own family,” shared Deepika in a chat with Vogue Singapore. Speaking about her family, she added, “When I meet the people I have grown up with—my aunts, uncles, family friends—they always mention how I haven’t changed one bit. That says a lot about our upbringing.” “In this industry, it’s easy to get carried away by fame and money. But no one treats me like a celebrity at home. I am a daughter and a sister first. I don’t want that to change. My family keeps me grounded and Ranveer and I hope to inculcate the same values in our children,” she added. It was back in 2019 when Deepika Padukone made it clear that while she and Ranveer want children, they weren’t thinking about itactively. She had also expressed her annoyance with the societal expectations from couples. “I think it’s sad that society kind of puts itself and people in this rut that okay you are dating for so long toh shaadi kab hogi, shaadi ke baad bacche and then grandchildren. It’s almost like it’s the said expectation. I’m not surprised (by the rumours), we’re not surprised by it at all,” Deepika shared while speaking with HT Cafe. She added, “Do we intent on having children? Of course we do, we both love kids. But do we intent on having children anytime soon? Absolutely not! We’re too selfishly at this point focused on our careers and I don’t think it would be fair to have kids at this point. We’re not even thinking about kids.” On the work front, Deepika awaited the release of her Siddharth Anand film, Fighter. Deepika will be sharing the screen with Hrithik Roshan. The film is set to release on January 25. Deepika was a part of two big blockbusters of 2023, Pathaan and Jawan. Click for more updates and latest Bollywood news along with Entertainment updates.

Janhvi neither confirmed or denied her rumoured relationship with Shikhar Pahariya, whom she used to date several years ago as well. After breaking up, they were said to have gotten back together recently. Karan asked Janhvi, “You have had an interesting path of love, you were dating Shikhar, and then you dated someone else and now you are dating Shikhar again. True or False?” Janhvi had an interesting answer to Karan’s question. She said, “Have you heard that song, ‘Nadaan Parindey Ghar Aaja’? Shikhar used to sing that to me a lot.” The Bawaal actor continued, “I won’t say that, but I will say this, he is, not just for me, but for her (Khushi), for dad and everyone in our family, he has been there from the start as a friend. Not in a way that made me feel like he is expecting anything or he is a pushover or any of those things. He was just there in a very selfless dignified way, and in a way that I have not seen many men capable of being there for another human being.”     A post shared by Janhvi Kapoor (@janhvikapoor) Karan also questioned Janhvi about about decision to not date actors.

When asked why she would ‘never’ date an actor, Janhvi said, “I want someone to be obsessed with me. The thing is, you need someone to be okay with your… there needs to be a balance. You need someone who is okay to let you have your moment also but I find with actors that they get very competitive and they get very weird. I’ve said never (date actors).” The actor continued, “There is always tension when there is an actor. I can’t deal with that tension because I like to be undyingly devoted and I expect that devotion and I think when you are in the same profession, it’s difficult, specifically this profession.” Khushi, who recently made her debut with Zoya Akhtar’s The Archies, is rumoured to be dating her co-star Vedang Raina.

125,3 arrested for stealing Nike shoes worth Rs 1 crore worth near Bengaluru,"Bengaluru Rural district police have arrested three men for allegedly stealing 1,558 pairs of Nike shoes worth Rs 1.10 crore to sell them at half price in other cities to make quick money. According to the police, the men, who were arrested on Tuesday, have been identified as Shuban Pasha, 30, Mansar Ali, 26, and Shahidul Rehman, 26, all from Assam. The mastermind behind the crime, Saleh Ahmed Laskar, is absconding, they said. The incident took place on December 21 last year when Laskar, a driver, was assigned to take these shoes from the Nike showroom in Attibele to the e-commerce portal Myntra’s warehouse on Soukya Road. Laskar left the Nike godown around 6.30 pm but did not reach the Myntra godown in time. His supervisor, Manjunath, called him around 9.15 pm and Laskar told him he would arrive in another 10 minutes. However, Manjunath found his mobile phone switched off after a while. When Myntra godown staff informed Manjunath they had not received the consignment, he located the vehicle through the GPS equipment installed in the truck near Tarabanahalli. Around 1.30 am, Manjunath went to the spot and found the shoes were missing from the abandoned vehicle. Nagaraju B, who runs the transport services to these firms, filed a complaint with the Attibele police on December 23 about the missing truck. The police who reviewed the CCTV footage found that the shoes were unloaded from the vehicle and stored in a room. Later, it was loaded into another vehicle. By then, the police who had the registration numbers of these vehicles managed to flag them off when the shoes were being transported. A police officer said it was a well-planned attempt, adding Laskar was previously arrested in connection with the theft of branded clothes. He had joined just a week ago before the incident took place, said the officer. During questioning the accused confessed to the police that they wanted to take these shoes to some other metropolitan city to sell them at half price, the officer said.",World,arrest steal nike shoe worth rs crore worth near bengaluru bengaluru rural district police arrest three men allegedly steal pair nike shoe worth rs crore sell half price cities make quick money accord police men arrest tuesday identify shuban pasha mansar ali shahidul rehman assam mastermind behind crime saleh ahmed laskar abscond say incident take place december last year laskar driver assign take shoe nike showroom attibele ecommerce portal myntras warehouse soukya road laskar leave nike godown around pm reach myntra godown time supervisor manjunath call around pm laskar tell would arrive another minutes however manjunath find mobile phone switch myntra godown staff inform manjunath receive consignment locate vehicle gps equipment instal truck near tarabanahalli around manjunath go spot find shoe miss abandon vehicle nagaraju b run transport service firm file complaint attibele police december miss truck police review cctv footage find shoe unload vehicle store room later load another vehicle police registration number vehicles manage flag shoe transport police officer say wellplanned attempt add laskar previously arrest connection theft brand clothe join week ago incident take place say officer question accuse confess police want take shoe metropolitan city sell half price officer say,3
126,Khushi Kapoor says father Boney Kapoor cried after watching The Archies; Janhvi Kapoor lists what her sister has in common with Sridevi: ‘My biases aside…’,"Sisters Janhvi Kapoor and Khushi Kapoor appeared as guests on the latest episode of Koffee with Karan, and they spoke candidly about their journey in the film business. Khushi also spoke about her family’s reaction to her debut movie. Khushi Kapoor, younger daughter of Boney Kapoor and Sridevi, made her debut with Zoya Akhtar’s The Archies. The film released last month on Netflix, and earned mixed reviews. During the episode, Karan asked Khushi about how she auditioned for the film. “I had just come back from New York, and I had no intention of starting out at that point. so when I went and auditioned, I was fully shaking. It was the first office I went to, first audition I had ever given, so I was scared. She (Zoya) made it really easy for me though, she calmed me down. I was freaking out, but I think it went well,” Khushi said. Indian Express Entertainment is now on WhatsApp Channels. Follow us for the latest news, interviews, reviews, photos and more. Once she landed the coveted part of Betty Cooper in the film, Khushi said she “immediately started howling” and crying. “I knew I wanted to do this for the longest time. In that moment I felt, ‘Okay, now it is happening for me.’ It was with Zoya and was the most ideal situation for me and I got really emotional.” The debutante revealed that Boney Kapoor got so emotional after watching The Archies that he started to cry. Janhvi added, “He cried for three days!” To which Khushi said, “I would get random messages from him saying, ‘You are just so good beta.’ It was really cute and sweet!”     A post shared by Netflix India (@netflix_in) Janhvi, who made her debut in 2018 with Karan Johar-backed Dhadak, said it was an “obviously” emotional moment for her to see Khushi act on screen and then listed what her younger sister has in common with mother Sridevi. “My biases aside, she is phenomenal, she is unreal. I have seen her for nine months, slog her a** off every day in every aspect of the film. She is a very quiet person and that is something she has in common with Mumma. But in front of the camera, she explodes. I didn’t know that all of this was cooking inside. I live with her, but I didn’t know that’s what it could convert to on screen. I really do think she is magical.” Apart from Khushi, The Archies also marked the acting debut of Shah Rukh Khan’s daughter, Suhana, and megastar Amitabh Bachchan’s grandson, Agastya Nanda. Ever since it was first announced, the film was attacked by a section that felt casting star kids in it was encouraging nepotism in the industry. It led to the three debutants being trolled, even before they were seen on screen. “I do read certain things sometimes, I try not to but you can’t help, you want to see what people are saying about you,” Khushi said when asked about trolling. “The first hate comment I read about myself was when I was 11 or 12 years old. Once you keep seeing it, you understand that it is not coming from anything concrete. It is just people taking out their own insecurities on you.” Click for more updates and latest Bollywood news along with Entertainment updates.

127,"Oil markets in highly turbulent situation, says Minister Puri on petrol, diesel price cut","Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Wednesday responded to expectations of a reduction in petrol and diesel prices in view of softening international oil rates, by saying that global market is in a “highly turbulent” situation and it has to stabilise before any cut. Three state-owned fuel retailers — Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) — which control roughly 90 per cent of the market, have kept petrol and diesel prices on freeze for a record 21 month in a row. This is despite the raw material (crude oil) cost surging last year, leading to heavy losses in the first half of 2022-23 fiscal year before easing rates propelled them to profitability in the last three quarters. “There has been no discussion with the oil marketing companies on any such issue,” Puri told reporters when asked if the government has held discussions with the three firms on a reduction in fuel prices. The oil companies, he said, make their own decisions of fuel pricing. “We are in highly turbulent situation. There are two areas on the global map which are in conflict situation,” he said referring to the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas conflict that has led to cargo ships being attacked in the Red Sea. Puri said 12 per cent of the global shipping traffic, 18 per cent of oil and 4-8 per cent of LNG trade goes through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. “God forbid, if there is further challenge or there is a disruption, you see an impact,” he said. International oil prices rebounded in the aftermath of the attack on ships in the Red Sea. The rates have however eased in subsequent days. “In a highly volatile situation, our primary responsibility is to ensure availability and affordability,” Puri said. “We are navigating this very carefully.” He said oil companies don’t ask the government about price revisions. “Pray to god that there is no turbulence, things are normal,” he added. While at current prices, oil companies are making some money on petrol, and diesel — the most consumed fuel accounting for almost 40 per cent of all petroleum products consumed in the country — but it has been in a “touch-and-go” scenario in recent weeks. On some days there is profit on diesel but on other days there is loss. There is no consistent trend. Three retailers had been recouping losses they incurred for holding rates when crude oil prices shot through the roof last year. In May, international oil prices and retail pump rates had come at par, but the subsequent surge widened the gulf between cost and price realised. For oil companies to reduce prices, oil prices will have to stabilise. Petrol and diesel prices have been on a freeze since April 6 last year. Petrol costs Rs 96.72 a litre in the national capital and diesel comes for Rs 89.62 per litre. The three firms made bumper profits in April-September — the first half of the current fiscal — but considering the low earnings of last year, they are yet to recoup all losses, officials said.",Business,oil market highly turbulent situation say minister puri petrol diesel price cut oil minister hardeep singh puri wednesday respond expectations reduction petrol diesel price view soften international oil rat say global market highly turbulent situation stabilise cut three stateowned fuel retailers indian oil corporation ltd iocl bharat petroleum corporation ltd bpcl hindustan petroleum corporation ltd hpcl control roughly per cent market keep petrol diesel price freeze record month row despite raw material crude oil cost surge last year lead heavy losses first half fiscal year ease rat propel profitability last three quarter discussion oil market company issue puri tell reporters ask government hold discussions three firm reduction fuel price oil company say make decisions fuel price highly turbulent situation two areas global map conflict situation say refer russiaukraine war israelhamas conflict lead cargo ship attack red sea puri say per cent global ship traffic per cent oil per cent lng trade go red sea suez canal god forbid challenge disruption see impact say international oil price rebound aftermath attack ship red sea rat however ease subsequent days highly volatile situation primary responsibility ensure availability affordability puri say navigate carefully say oil company dont ask government price revisions pray god turbulence things normal add current price oil company make money petrol diesel consume fuel account almost per cent petroleum products consume country touchandgo scenario recent weeks days profit diesel days loss consistent trend three retailers recoup losses incur hold rat crude oil price shoot roof last year may international oil price retail pump rat come par subsequent surge widen gulf cost price realise oil company reduce price oil price stabilise petrol diesel price freeze since april last year petrol cost rs litre national capital diesel come rs per litre three firm make bumper profit aprilseptember first half current fiscal consider low earn last year yet recoup losses officials say,0
128,"Once Google’s highest paid executive, how Nikesh Arora became a billionaire","Chairman and CEO of Palo Alto Networks Nikesh Arora, once Google’s highest paid executive, is now a billionaire. Before joining Palo Alto Networks in June 2018, Arora served as president and chief operating officer of SoftBank Group Corp. During his tenure, he struck a $250-million deal for a minority stake in Legendary Entertainment, after an unsuccessful attempt at partnership with DreamWorks Animation, sources had told Reuters. Arora was also instrumental in SoftBank’s investments in Indian entities like Snapdeal, Ola, Grofers, Housing.com and Oyo Rooms. Ken Miyauchi, head of SoftBank’s Japanese telecommunications operations, replaced Nikesh Arora as president and chief operating officer, who stepped down from the post in 2016. During his decade-long tenure at Google, Arora oversaw sales, marketing and partnerships, an outsider’s job at a company, where engineering skills are prized above all else. He became one of the most powerful Google executives, and the highest paid in 2012, when he made $51 million in cash and stock. Arora advocated for Google to acquire online movie company Netflix in 2009, according to a former employee, who was present when Arora pitched the idea to the tech giant’s senior executive team. At the time, Netflix had a market cap of roughly $3 billion, compared to its current $27 billion valuation. Arora also proposed at the time that Google should acquire LoveFilm, a UK-based streaming video company that was later acquired by Amazon in 2011, the person said. Prior to joining Google, Nikesh held the role of chief marketing officer for the T-Mobile International Division of Deutsche Telekom AG. He was the chief executive officer and founder of T-Motion PLC, which merged with T-Mobile International in 2002. Besides SoftBank Group Corp, he has also served on the boards of Sprint Corp, Colgate-Palmolive Inc and Yahoo! Japan, among others. He holds an MS in Business Administration from Northeastern University, an MS in finance from Boston College and a B.

129,India’s wheat output may touch new record of 114 million tonnes in 2023-24,"Wheat production is expected to touch a new record of 114 million tonnes in the ongoing 2023-24 crop year on higher coverage and provided weather conditions remain normal, a top food ministry official said on Wednesday. The last leg of sowing of wheat, the main rabi (winter) crop, is underway and will continue till next week. Till last week, wheat was planted in 320.54 lakh hectares, as per the official data. Wheat production stood at a record 110.55 million tonnes in the 2022-23 crop year (July-June), compared to 107.7 million tonnes achieved in the previous year. “We expect that total area under cultivation of wheat will increase this year and God willingly if the climate is alright, the production will be 114 million tonne that’s what the agriculture ministry has indicated informally to us,” Food Corporation of India (FCI) Chairman and Managing Director Ashok K Meena told reporters. Area sown to wheat crop is also showing an increase compared to the last year. There was a deficit of one per cent in some states but that will also be made up in the first week of January, he said. “If that is the level of production, we are very confident that we will be able to procure more than our requirement and also additional stocks needed for the Open Market Sale Scheme (OMSS) for next year,” he noted. When asked if the central nodal agency plans to step up procurement considering the opening wheat balance of 76 lakh tonnes to be on April 1, which is just enough to meet the buffer requirement, the FCI chief said: “We will try our best to provide minimum support price (MSP) to all farmers. Because of the open market sale, the indications are prices have stabilised and are not higher than it was last year. “Since the wheat MSP is higher by 7 per cent than the last year, we hope that lot of farmers will be willing to give their produce to the FCI,” Meena said. Last year, the FCI’s wheat procurement stood at 26.2 million tonnes, higher than the annual buffer requirement of 18.4 million tonnes. This year’s wheat crop will be ready for harvest from April onwards. FCI is the central nodal agency that buys rice and wheat to ensure MSP to the farmers and distributes the grains for free to 81 crore poor via ration shops. It also uses surplus grain via OMSS to boost domestic availability and check prices. Curbing wheat & rice inflation through OMSS:
According to FCI, 5.9 million tonnes of wheat has been sold in the open market through weekly e-auction under the OMSS since June 2023, which has helped stabilise the retail prices. “There has been hardly any increase in retail wheat prices on YoY basis,” the FCI Chairman said, adding that wheat OMSS will continue only till March 15. However in the case of rice, there is “of course an uptick in prices visible in the open market but the mere fact that we are making huge quantity of rice available through OMSS, I hope that the prices will also not increase substantially”, he said. There has been a lukewarm response for rice under OMSS and so far the FCI has been able to sell only 1.45 lakh tonnes at Rs 29 per kg through weekly auctions. The FCI is using surplus foodgrain stock of 15.6 million tonnes for undertaking market intervention to stabilise the prices of two key commodities. “Our OMSS intervention has helped stabilise prices of these two commodities. Rice and wheat being important part of CPI basket, we would hope that food related inflation will get controlled to the maximum possible,” he added. Launch of ‘Bharat rice’:
With a few takers for FCI rice under the OMSS, the FCI chief said there is a proposal under consideration to retail the grain under the ‘Bharat’ brand. The FCI has informed the food ministry that it has enough rice stock for the same. “The quantity and price at which Bharat rice to be sold is the decision of the ministry,” he said. Sources said not much offtake of FCI rice for this new scheme is expected. Status of this year’s rice procurement:
FCI has procured 31.1 million tonnes of rice so far in the ongoing 2023-24 marketing season (September-October), while the target set by state governments is 52.1 million tonnes. In terms of paddy, procurement was at 46.4 million tonnes so far this year, lower than 53.4 million tonnes in the year-ago period. “One reason for lower procurement is that the paddy prices in the open market are also very high. The other reason is the pace of procurement was slow in states like Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh due to assembly elections,” he said. However, the procurement is likely to pick up going forward when the states are about to announce bonus to farmers, he said. In West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh, paddy procurement is sluggish as open market prices this year remain high, he added. The FCI chief further said there is “no cause of concern about the availability of rice for buffer” because the quantity of rice procured so far is good enough to meet the requirement of welfare schemes. “The annual requirement of the rice for maintaining a buffer to meet all welfare scheme is 40-41 million tonnes. I am well on course to meet the requirement,” the FCI chief said.
In the 2022-23 marketing season, the FCI had purchased 56.9 million tonnes of rice. According to the FCI, total foodgrain stock was at 34.4 million tonnes as on January 1. About 32.8 million tonnes of rice is being milled, which will take the total central pool stock to 67.2 million tonnes. On funds required for undertaking procurement, the FCI chief said, “Till now, the flow of funds under food subsidy is extremely comfortable. Right now, there is zero short-term loan with FCI.”",Business,indias wheat output may touch new record million tonnes wheat production expect touch new record million tonnes ongoing crop year higher coverage provide weather condition remain normal top food ministry official say wednesday last leg sow wheat main rabi winter crop underway continue till next week till last week wheat plant lakh hectares per official data wheat production stand record million tonnes crop year julyjune compare million tonnes achieve previous year expect total area cultivation wheat increase year god willingly climate alright production million tonne thats agriculture ministry indicate informally us food corporation india fci chairman manage director ashok k meena tell reporters area sow wheat crop also show increase compare last year deficit one per cent state also make first week january say level production confident able procure requirement also additional stock need open market sale scheme omss next year note ask central nodal agency plan step procurement consider open wheat balance lakh tonnes april enough meet buffer requirement fci chief say try best provide minimum support price msp farmers open market sale indications price stabilise higher last year since wheat msp higher per cent last year hope lot farmers will give produce fci meena say last year fcis wheat procurement stand million tonnes higher annual buffer requirement million tonnes years wheat crop ready harvest april onwards fci central nodal agency buy rice wheat ensure msp farmers distribute grain free crore poor via ration shop also use surplus grain via omss boost domestic availability check price curb wheat rice inflation omssaccording fci million tonnes wheat sell open market weekly eauction omss since june help stabilise retail price hardly increase retail wheat price yoy basis fci chairman say add wheat omss continue till march however case rice course uptick price visible open market mere fact make huge quantity rice available omss hope price also increase substantially say lukewarm response rice omss far fci able sell lakh tonnes rs per kg weekly auction fci use surplus foodgrain stock million tonnes undertake market intervention stabilise price two key commodities omss intervention help stabilise price two commodities rice wheat important part cpi basket would hope food relate inflation get control maximum possible add launch bharat ricewith takers fci rice omss fci chief say proposal consideration retail grain bharat brand fci inform food ministry enough rice stock quantity price bharat rice sell decision ministry say source say much offtake fci rice new scheme expect status years rice procurementfci procure million tonnes rice far ongoing market season septemberoctober target set state governments million tonnes term paddy procurement million tonnes far year lower million tonnes yearago period one reason lower procurement paddy price open market also high reason pace procurement slow state like telangana chhattisgarh madhya pradesh due assembly elections say however procurement likely pick go forward state announce bonus farmers say west bengal uttar pradesh paddy procurement sluggish open market price year remain high add fci chief say cause concern availability rice buffer quantity rice procure far good enough meet requirement welfare scheme annual requirement rice maintain buffer meet welfare scheme million tonnes well course meet requirement fci chief saidin market season fci purchase million tonnes rice accord fci total foodgrain stock million tonnes january million tonnes rice mill take total central pool stock million tonnes fund require undertake procurement fci chief say till flow fund food subsidy extremely comfortable right zero shortterm loan fci,0

European markets were trading lower. The US markets ended mostly lower on Tuesday. “The lack of fresh triggers and concerns over valuation influenced investors to stay sidelined.

India’s manufacturing sector growth fell to an 18-month low in December amid softer increase in factory orders and output, despite minimal inflation, a monthly survey said on Wednesday.

131,Adani stocks rally as SC says no ground to transfer Hindenburg probe from SEBI to SIT,"Adani Group Stocks Today: Shares of Adani Group of companies made heavy gains on Wednesday morning in intra-day trading as the Supreme Court ruled that there was no ground to order an investigation by a SIT or other probe agency into allegations raised by US-based short seller Hindenburg group against the group. A three-judge bench presided by Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud noted that SEBI had completed the investigation in 20 out of the 22 matters in connection with the allegations levelled against the Adani group, and directed that probe into the other two pending cases be completed expeditiously, preferably within three months. Adani Energy Solutions surged 17.83 per cent, NDTV jumped 11.39 per cent, Adani Total Gas climbed 9.99 per cent, Adani Green Energy soared 9.13 per cent and Adani Enterprises surged 9.11 per cent on the BSE. Similarly, shares of Adani Wilmar went up by 8.52 per cent, Adani Ports climbed 6 per cent, Adani Power (4.99 per cent), Ambuja Cements (3.46 per cent) and ACC 2.96 per cent. Two of the group firms — Adani Ports and Ambuja Cements — also hit their 52-week high levels during the morning trade. In the equity market, the 30-share BSE Sensex traded 319.47 points lower at 71,544.60, and the Nifty quoted 104.30 points down at 21,561.50. The Supreme Court rejected allegations of conflict of interest raised by the petitioners against some of the members of its expert committee and said the charges were “unsubstantiated”. The court said that the facts of the case do not warrant a transfer of investigation from SEBI. The judgment said that though it has the power to transfer the investigation in an appropriate case, such power is exercised in an extraordinary case when the competent authority portrays glaring, wilful and deliberate inaction in carrying out the investigation. “The threshold for the transfer of investigation has not been demonstrated to exist” in the case, the court said. It rejected the reliance placed by the petitioners on the report by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCPR) to suggest that SEBI was lackadaisical in conducting the investigation and said “a report by a third party organisation without any attempt to verify the authenticity of its allegations cannot be regarded as conclusive proof”. After the Hindenburg report accused the Adani group of “brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades” in January last year, the OCCRP, in September, made fresh allegations of stock manipulation against the group. The OCCRP report said, “in at least two cases … [supposedly public] investors turn out to have widely reported ties to the group’s majority shareholders, the Adani family”, and helped manipulate Adani companies’ stock prices.

With states anticipating higher expenditure and having proposed record borrowing of Rs 4.13 lakh crore in the January-March quarter (Q4), the yield spread between the 10-year state governments’ loans and the benchmark 10-year G-sec is expected to widen further amid concerns of higher supply of dated securities, experts said. “The Q4 FY24 SDL calendar implies that there will be a significant supply of duration, when seen in conjunction with G-sec supply…the gross supply from states and Centre is likely to be concentrated in the 15-year to 50-year segment, at around 35% of total Q4 FY24 supply. This is likely to result in steepening of the curve. Moreover, the large supply for states will further widen the spreads between SDLs and G-sec,” Gaura Sen Gupta, Economist, IDFC First Bank said. The higher supply of state government securities along with G-sec supply is expected to weigh on state government bonds this quarter, with higher borrowing expected to lead to a rise in the borrowing cost for states compared with Centre. The weighted average cut-off of state government securities increased by a sharp 8 bps to 7.71 per cent on Tuesday from 7.63 per cent last week and the spread between the cut-off of 10-year state government securities and the 10-year G-sec (7.18 per cent, 2033 bond) yield widened to 53 bps on Tuesday from 48 bps last week, highest since January 2022, ICRA said.  “In our view, if the weekly SGS auctions in Q4 FY2024 are closer to the indicated amount, the spreads between the 10-year SGS and 10-year G-sec yield may widen to 50-60 bps in this quarter, especially in February-March 2024,” Aditi Nayar, Chief Economist, ICRA said. Last week, the Reserve Bank of India had released the indicative calendar of market borrowings by state governments and union territories (UTs), wherein a record borrowing of Rs 4.13 lakh crore has been proposed by states and UTs in the last quarter of this financial year, over 37.4 per cent higher year-on-year. Estimates by economists had pegged states’ borrowing to be around Rs 3.4-3.5 lakh crore in Q4. Among states, Karnataka, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu constitute the majority share in the proposed borrowing, with Karnataka and West Bengal accounting for nearly 80 per cent of the incremental indicated borrowing amount of Rs 1.1 lakh crore for Q4. However, the actual borrowing by states could turn out to be lower than the indicated borrowing. ICRA said some states may have estimated their Q4 borrowing by subtracting their actual issuance in nine months so far from the total permitted borrowing for FY2024 by the Government of India. Release of additional funds under the capex loan scheme in Q4 and tax devolution could also help limit the total states’ borrowing, it said. After a gap of 10 quarters, the actual borrowing by states had exceeded the indicated amount by 4 per cent or Rs 8,700 crore in October-December. The total borrowing by states in April-December stood at Rs 6 lakh crore, 90 per cent of the amount indicated for this period (Rs 6.7 lakh crore) compared with 70 per cent in the year-ago period (Rs 4.6 lakh crore actual borrowing vs Rs 6.5 lakh crore indicated). Though the Centre has given two advance instalments of tax devolution to states/UTs by December-end, a slower nominal GDP growth, moderation in indirect tax and own tax revenue of states and grants by Centre are being seen as the likely factors to have pushed states to indicate higher borrowing. “Grants from Centre are tracking 26.4 per cent YoY lower in FY24 (Apr-Oct) v/s full year budgeted growth of 24.6 per cent in FY24 Budget Estimate. Grants from Centre consist of Central sector schemes, centrally sponsored schemes, finance commission grants and GST compensation cess. A part of the decline was expected with the discontinuation of sharing of GST cess revenue with states since June 2022…the sharper than budgeted decline is likely due to reduction in 15th Finance Commission Grants. Data from Centre (Department of Expenditure), indicates a 31% YoY decline in FY24 (Apr-Nov), led by revenue deficit grants and grants for rural bodies,” Sen Gupta said.

133,"Exports from labour intensive sectors lagging, says GTRI","India’s exports from the labour- intensive sector such as textiles, garments, gems and jewellery, and leather exports have slowed despite the free trade agreements (FTAs) in the past as efficient suppliers from China, Vietnam and Bangladesh gained market share in global trade, a report by think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said. Overall goods exports have been on the decline for the better part of the ongoing financial year due to demand slowdown in the west – a key consumer of Indian textile and gems and jewellery exports. Property crisis in China has also resulted in slowing of Indian exports. The think tank said that among the key reasons for weak exports in these sectors are non-tariff barriers (NTBs) imposed by consumer nations and that India should use the ongoing free trade agreements negotiations to eliminate such barriers. NTBs are trade restrictions in the form of regulations or quotas designed to limit imports without the explicit use of tariffs. At a time when India is signing free trade agreements with developed nations such as the UK, GTRI said that mere signing of an FTA may not result in a rise in India’s labour-intensive Goods exports and India’s export of apparel to Japan is an example.
“Most-favored nation (MFN) duties on Apparel in Japan are 10 per cent. During the FTA negotiations in 2008-2010, it was thought that if Japan could reduce duties to zero post-FTA, India’s apparel exports to Japan would get a significant boost. Both countries agreed to eliminate duties on all apparel from day one of the entry into force of the India –Japan FTA. But data from the past 12 years show that the expected gains did not happen,” GTRI said.
“Competition from more efficient suppliers from China, Vietnam, or Bangladesh could be a reason. Developed countries with high per capita income prefer high-fashion branded apparel produced in large units. While developed countries buy 70 per cent of apparel from mixed synthetics, their share in India’s exports is less than 40 per cent. On average, India’s labor-intensive manufacturing units employ 20 workers compared to 1,000 in China,” it added. Earlier this year, Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) had also said that an analysis of sector-wise export performance for the last five years revealed the troubling pattern that India is experiencing a decline in global market share across labour-intensive sectors. FIEO said that India’s export growth during the last few years can largely be attributed to a rerouting of crude oil trade routes via India to Europe and that “this phenomenon may not be sustainable in the coming years.",Business,export labour intensive sectors lag say gtri indias export labour intensive sector textiles garment gems jewellery leather export slow despite free trade agreements ftas past efficient suppliers china vietnam bangladesh gain market share global trade report think tank global trade research initiative gtri say overall goods export decline better part ongoing financial year due demand slowdown west key consumer indian textile gems jewellery export property crisis china also result slow indian export think tank say among key reason weak export sectors nontariff barriers ntbs impose consumer nations india use ongoing free trade agreements negotiations eliminate barriers ntbs trade restrictions form regulations quotas design limit import without explicit use tariff time india sign free trade agreements develop nations uk gtri say mere sign fta may result rise indias labourintensive goods export indias export apparel japan examplemostfavored nation mfn duties apparel japan per cent fta negotiations think japan could reduce duties zero postfta indias apparel export japan would get significant boost countries agree eliminate duties apparel day one entry force india japan fta data past years show expect gain happen gtri saidcompetition efficient suppliers china vietnam bangladesh could reason develop countries high per capita income prefer highfashion brand apparel produce large units develop countries buy per cent apparel mix synthetics share indias export less per cent average indias laborintensive manufacture units employ workers compare china add earlier year federation indian export organisations fieo also say analysis sectorwise export performance last five years reveal trouble pattern india experience decline global market share across labourintensive sectors fieo say indias export growth last years largely attribute rerouting crude oil trade rout via india europe phenomenon may sustainable come years,0
134,India’s domestic air passenger traffic at record high in 2023,"India’s domestic air passenger traffic hit a record high in 2023, dwarfing the pre-pandemic peaks and marking the sector’s full recovery from Covid-19’s impact. Domestic air traffic in 2023 is estimated at an all-time high of 15.2 crore passengers, beating the previous record of 14.4 crore passengers in 2019, as per data compiled and analysed by aviation analytics firm Network Thoughts. “With this, the recovery is complete and a year ahead of IATA’s (International Air Transport Association) original estimation of traffic reaching pre-Covid levels by 2024. While the year recorded an all-time high, the month of December 2023 recorded highest ever monthly traffic in the history of civil aviation in India,” the firm said in a recent report on India’s domestic aviation landscape in 2023. “The resilience in traffic comes at a time when airlines have not been able to deploy full capacity owing to a mix of financial and engine issues at various airlines and suspension of services by one airline (Go First). This has led to higher load factors across airlines in 2023,” the report said. The data suggests that the industry has fully recovered from the impact of Go First’s grounding. The airline has not operated since early May after it voluntarily filed for insolvency. The official monthly aviation traffic data, which is released by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), has not been released yet for December 2023. It is expected to be released in the next two to three weeks. On an average, Indian carriers ferried 4.17 lakh passengers a day on domestic flights in 2023, and the average daily domestic flight count stood at 2,891. Except November, the domestic air passenger traffic in all months of 2023 was higher than the corresponding months of 2019. On the outlook for 2024, the report said, “With a 5 per cent growth over 2023 (same as last year), the domestic air traffic would reach 15.97 crore. A more realistic figure of 10 per cent growth will take the traffic to 16.72 crore domestic passengers while 15 per cent growth—which has been recorded in the past—will take the domestic air traffic to 17.48 crore domestic passengers in 2024”. India is the third-largest and fastest-growing aviation market in the world, and has huge potential for growth as a sizable section of the population remains untapped. With primary players IndiGo and the Air India group embarking on massive network and capacity expansion plans with mega aircraft orders, the sector is expected to witness significant growth over the coming years.",Business,indias domestic air passenger traffic record high indias domestic air passenger traffic hit record high dwarf prepandemic peak mark sectors full recovery covids impact domestic air traffic estimate alltime high crore passengers beat previous record crore passengers per data compile analyse aviation analytics firm network thoughts recovery complete year ahead iatas international air transport association original estimation traffic reach precovid level year record alltime high month december record highest ever monthly traffic history civil aviation india firm say recent report indias domestic aviation landscape resilience traffic come time airlines able deploy full capacity owe mix financial engine issue various airlines suspension service one airline go first lead higher load factor across airlines report say data suggest industry fully recover impact go firsts ground airline operate since early may voluntarily file insolvency official monthly aviation traffic data release directorate general civil aviation dgca release yet december expect release next two three weeks average indian carriers ferry lakh passengers day domestic flight average daily domestic flight count stand except november domestic air passenger traffic months higher correspond months outlook report say per cent growth last year domestic air traffic would reach crore realistic figure per cent growth take traffic crore domestic passengers per cent growthwhich record pastwill take domestic air traffic crore domestic passengers india thirdlargest fastestgrowing aviation market world huge potential growth sizable section population remain untapped primary players indigo air india group embark massive network capacity expansion plan mega aircraft order sector expect witness significant growth come years,0
135,Inoperative & unclaimed accounts: How will the RBI’s revised guidelines benefit customers?,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has revised guidelines for classifying accounts and deposits as inoperative accounts and unclaimed deposits by banks. As per the norms, account holders can reactivate their inoperative accounts/ unclaimed deposits by submitting know your customer (KYC) documents afresh at all branches, including non-home branches, of banks in which they have an account. A savings or current account is treated as inoperative, if there are no ‘customer induced transactions’ in the account for a period of over two years. A customer induced transaction can be a financial transaction initiated by or done at the behest of the account holder by the bank or third party, or a non-financial transaction, or a KYC (know your customer) updation done in face-to-face physical mode or through digital channels such as internet banking or mobile banking application of the bank. Around Rs 1-1.30 lakh crore is estimated to be lying in inoperative bank accounts. Balances in savings / current accounts which are not operated for 10 years, or term deposits not claimed within 10 years from date of maturity are classified as ‘unclaimed deposits’. The government recently informed the Parliament that unclaimed deposits of Rs 42,270 crore are lying with the banks as of March 2023. The RBI has asked banks to undertake at least an annual review in respect of accounts, where there are no customer induced transactions for more than a year. In cases where there is no explicit mandate to renew the term deposit, banks need to review such accounts if the customers have not withdrawn the proceeds after maturity or transferred these to their savings/current account in order to prevent such deposits from becoming unclaimed. Banks should communicate to the account or deposit holders through letters or email or SMS that there has been no operation in their accounts in the last one year. The alert messages should invariably mention that the account would become ‘inoperative’ if no operations are carried out during the next one year and, the account holder would be required to submit KYC documents afresh for reactivating the account in such case. For the purpose of classifying an account as inoperative, only customer induced transactions and not bank induced transactions shall be considered. There may be instances where the customer has given a mandate like standing instructions (SI)/ auto-renewal instructions and there are no other operations in the savings /current account or the term deposit. These transactions shall also be treated as customer-induced transactions. Bank-induced transactions are transactions in the account initiated by the bank such as charges, fees, interest payments, penalties and taxes. The classification of an account as inoperative will be for a particular account of the customer and not with reference to the customer. Banks open zero balance accounts for beneficiaries of Central/State government schemes and for students who receive scholarships. Central and State governments have been expressing difficulty in crediting cheques or direct benefit transfer or electronic benefit transfer or scholarship amount in these accounts as they are also classified as inoperative due to non-operation for two years. The RBI said that banks should, based on the purpose of opening of the account, segregate such accounts in their core banking solution (CBS), so that the stipulation of ‘inoperative’ accounts is not applicable to these accounts due to their non-operation for a period of more than two years. The RBI has asked banks to make available the facility of updation of KYC for activation of inoperative accounts and unclaimed deposits at all branches (including non-home branches) and through video-customer identification process (V-CIP) if requested by the account holder and subject to the facility of V-CIP being provided by the bank. Banks should activate the inoperative accounts or unclaimed deposits only after adhering to the KYC guidelines, it said. The RBI has said that no charges should be levied for activation of inoperative accounts. The banks are not permitted to levy penal charges for non-maintenance of minimum balances in any account that is classified as an inoperative account. Interest on savings accounts should be credited on a regular basis irrespective of the fact that the account is in operation or not, the RBI said.",Business,inoperative unclaimed account rbis revise guidelines benefit customers reserve bank india rbi revise guidelines classify account deposit inoperative account unclaimed deposit bank per norms account holders reactivate inoperative account unclaimed deposit submit know customer kyc document afresh branch include nonhome branch bank account save current account treat inoperative customer induce transactions account period two years customer induce transaction financial transaction initiate do behest account holder bank third party nonfinancial transaction kyc know customer updation do facetoface physical mode digital channel internet bank mobile bank application bank around rs lakh crore estimate lie inoperative bank account balance save current account operate years term deposit claim within years date maturity classify unclaimed deposit government recently inform parliament unclaimed deposit rs crore lie bank march rbi ask bank undertake least annual review respect account customer induce transactions year case explicit mandate renew term deposit bank need review account customers withdraw proceed maturity transfer savingscurrent account order prevent deposit become unclaimed bank communicate account deposit holders letter email sms operation account last one year alert message invariably mention account would become inoperative operations carry next one year account holder would require submit kyc document afresh reactivate account case purpose classify account inoperative customer induce transactions bank induce transactions shall consider may instance customer give mandate like stand instructions si autorenewal instructions operations save current account term deposit transactions shall also treat customerinduced transactions bankinduced transactions transactions account initiate bank charge fee interest payments penalties tax classification account inoperative particular account customer reference customer bank open zero balance account beneficiaries centralstate government scheme students receive scholarships central state governments express difficulty credit cheque direct benefit transfer electronic benefit transfer scholarship amount account also classify inoperative due nonoperation two years rbi say bank base purpose open account segregate account core bank solution cbs stipulation inoperative account applicable account due nonoperation period two years rbi ask bank make available facility updation kyc activation inoperative account unclaimed deposit branch include nonhome branch videocustomer identification process vcip request account holder subject facility vcip provide bank bank activate inoperative account unclaimed deposit adhere kyc guidelines say rbi say charge levy activation inoperative account bank permit levy penal charge nonmaintenance minimum balance account classify inoperative account interest save account credit regular basis irrespective fact account operation rbi say,0
136,RBI proposed easing of norms for dividend payout by banks,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Tuesday has proposed to give permission for banks having net non-performing assets (NPAs) ratio of less than 6 per cent to declare dividends. Currently, banks need to have a NNPA ratio of up to 7 per cent to become eligible for declaration of dividends. “The net NPA ratio, for the financial year for which the dividend is proposed, should be less than six per cent,” the RBI said in the draft guidelines on dividend declaration. The guidelines have been reviewed in the light of implementation of Basel III standards, the revision of the prompt corrective action (PCA) framework, and the introduction of differentiated banks, the RBI said. The central bank has proposed that the new guidelines should come into effect from FY25 onwards. The RBI said a commercial bank should have a minimum total capital adequacy of 11.5 per cent to be eligible for declaring dividend, while the same for a small finance bank and payment banks has been set at 15 per cent, and 9 per cent for local area banks and regional rural banks. The RBI has proposed increasing the upper ceiling on dividend payout ratio — which is the ratio between the amount of the dividend payable in a year and the net profit — to 50 per cent if the net NPA is zero from the earlier ceiling of 40 per cent. The draft also made it clear that the Reserve Bank should not entertain any request for “ad-hoc dispensation on declaration of dividend”.",Business,rbi propose ease norms dividend payout bank reserve bank india rbi tuesday propose give permission bank net nonperforming assets npas ratio less per cent declare dividends currently bank need nnpa ratio per cent become eligible declaration dividends net npa ratio financial year dividend propose less six per cent rbi say draft guidelines dividend declaration guidelines review light implementation basel iii standards revision prompt corrective action pca framework introduction differentiate bank rbi say central bank propose new guidelines come effect fy onwards rbi say commercial bank minimum total capital adequacy per cent eligible declare dividend small finance bank payment bank set per cent per cent local area bank regional rural bank rbi propose increase upper ceiling dividend payout ratio ratio amount dividend payable year net profit per cent net npa zero earlier ceiling per cent draft also make clear reserve bank entertain request adhoc dispensation declaration dividend,0
137,"December manufacturing PMI at 18-month low on slower pace of orders, output","India’s manufacturing sector activity slowed to an 18-month low in December due to softening of output and new orders, a monthly survey said on Wednesday. The seasonally adjusted HSBC India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to 54.9 last month from 56 in November. A PMI reading above 50 indicates an overall expansion in manufacturing activity compared to the previous month and a print below 50 shows an overall decrease. Despite a loss of growth momentum, the manufacturing sector still expanded strongly in the month. There were softer, albeit sharp, increases in factory orders and output, while business confidence towards the year-ahead outlook strengthened, S&P Global said. “India’s manufacturing sector continued to expand in December, although at a softer pace, following an uptick in the previous month. Growth of both output and new orders softened, but on the other hand, the future output index rose since November. Rates of increase in input and output prices were broadly unchanged,” said Pranjul Bhandari, Chief India Economist at HSBC. During the reporting month, new business gains, favourable market conditions, fairs and expositions collectively induced another sharp increase in manufacturing production. However, the rate of expansion softened to the weakest since October 2022 even as it remained above its long-run average. Growth was reportedly curbed by fading demand for certain types of products, S&P Global said. New orders placed with Indian manufacturers rose sharply but to a lesser extent in December. The pace of expansion was the slowest seen in a year-and-a-half. December data showed a twenty-first consecutive increase in international order receipts at goods producers in India. Companies noted gains from clients in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and North America. New export sales expanded at a moderate pace that was the joint-slowest in eight months. Goods producers signalled a further uptick in purchasing costs at the end of the 2023 calendar year. Among the items reported to have been up in price were chemicals, paper and textiles. Little-changed from November, however, the rate of inflation was negligible by historical standards and was the second-weakest in just under three-and-a-half years, the survey said. For the fourth month in a row, the rate of charge inflation surpassed that of input prices. Survey participants that hiked their fees in December mentioned the pass-through of recently absorbed cost burdens to clients, it said. Employment was largely stable in December, with the respective seasonally adjusted index registering only fractionally above the 50 no-change mark. In terms of stocks, the latest results showed a further increase in input holdings alongside another decline in inventories of finished products. The latter was attributed to the fulfilment of orders from warehoused items. When assessing the year-ahead outlook for production, S&P Global said, Indian manufacturers were at their most upbeat for three months. The HSBC India Manufacturing PMI is compiled by S&P Global from responses to questionnaires sent to purchasing managers in a panel of around 400 manufacturers.",Business,december manufacture pmi month low slower pace order output indias manufacture sector activity slow month low december due soften output new order monthly survey say wednesday seasonally adjust hsbc india manufacture purchase managers index pmi fell last month november pmi read indicate overall expansion manufacture activity compare previous month print show overall decrease despite loss growth momentum manufacture sector still expand strongly month softer albeit sharp increase factory order output business confidence towards yearahead outlook strengthen sp global say indias manufacture sector continue expand december although softer pace follow uptick previous month growth output new order soften hand future output index rise since november rat increase input output price broadly unchanged say pranjul bhandari chief india economist hsbc report month new business gain favourable market condition fair expositions collectively induce another sharp increase manufacture production however rate expansion soften weakest since october even remain longrun average growth reportedly curb fade demand certain type products sp global say new order place indian manufacturers rise sharply lesser extent december pace expansion slowest see yearandahalf december data show twentyfirst consecutive increase international order receipt goods producers india company note gain clients asia europe middle east north america new export sales expand moderate pace jointslowest eight months goods producers signal uptick purchase cost end calendar year among items report price chemicals paper textiles littlechanged november however rate inflation negligible historical standards secondweakest threeandahalf years survey say fourth month row rate charge inflation surpass input price survey participants hike fee december mention passthrough recently absorb cost burden clients say employment largely stable december respective seasonally adjust index register fractionally nochange mark term stock latest result show increase input hold alongside another decline inventory finish products latter attribute fulfilment order warehouse items assess yearahead outlook production sp global say indian manufacturers upbeat three months hsbc india manufacture pmi compile sp global responses questionnaires send purchase managers panel around manufacturers,0
138,India Ratings raises FY24 GDP growth estimate to 6.7%,"India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) has revised upwards India’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth estimate for FY24 to 6.7 per cent from earlier 6.2 per cent, citing a number of factors including the resilience of the Indian economy, which grew 7.6 per cent in the second quarter of FY24. According to Ind-Ra, the other factors that will boost the growth are: sustained government capex, deleveraged balance sheet of corporates/banking sector, the prospect of a new private corporate capex cycle, and sustained momentum in business and software services exports, coupled with remittances from the rest of the world despite global headwinds. However, it said there are risks to the global growth. The World Trade Organization (WTO) expects the world merchandise trade volume to have grown only 0.8 per cent as against the expected 1.7 per cent in 2023. However, WTO expects world merchandise trade volume to grow 3.3 per cent in 2024. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects the global growth to slow down to 2.9 per cent in 2024 (2023: 3 per cent), lower than the pre-pandemic average growth of 3.8 per cent (2000-19). While the IMF expects the growth decline in emerging markets and developing economies in 2023 to have been only 10 bps in 2023 at 4 per cent (2022:4.1 per cent), it has been sharper in advanced economies at 110 bps to 1.5 per cent (2.6 per cent), it said. The IMF further expects the growth in advanced economies to slow down to 1.4 per cent in 2024 as the monetary policy tightening pursued by the central banks in these countries will continue to bite. However, the tighter monetary policies would translate in to global inflation declining to 6.9 per cent in 2023 and 5.8 per cent in 2024 (2022: 8.7 per cent). Another risk that may impact the global growth and trade especially through disruptions in the supply chain is the volatile geopolitical situation — the Baltic Dry Index jumped to a six-quarter high of 2,079 in Q3FY24 from 1,194 in Q2FY24, it said. “All these risks will continue to weigh on and restrict India’s GDP growth to 6.7 per cent in FY24 (FY23: 7.2 per cent). The quarterly GDP growth, which came in at 7.8 per cent and 7.6 per cent in Q1 of FY24 and Q2 of FY24 respectively, is slated to slow down sequentially in the remaining two quarters of FY24,” said Sunil Kumar Sinha, Principal Economist, Ind-Ra. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) also expects a sequential slowdown in the GDP growth in the remaining two quarters and expects the overall FY24 GDP to come in at 7.0 per cent. The National Statistical Office is slated to release the first advance estimates for GDP for FY24 on Friday. The first advance estimates of GDP, obtained by extrapolation of data of the first seven-eight months of the ongoing financial year (FY24), are released early to help officers in the Ministry of Finance and other departments in framing the broad contours of Union Budget for the next financial year which is presented in Parliament on February 1. Ind-Ra expects the private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) to grow 5.2 per cent in FY24 (FY23: 7.5 per cent). The PFCE growth which increased to 6.0 per cent in Q1 of FY24, declined to 3.1 per cent in Q2 of FY24 (first half of FY24: 4.5 per cent).
However, PFCE growth in the second half of FY24 will benefit from the base effect (PFCE growth in H2 of FY23: 2.5 per cent). Therefore, Ind-Ra expects PFCE in 2HFY24 to grow 5.8 per cent. It said wage growth is critical for consumption growth. Ind-Ra’s calculation shows that a 1 per cent increase in real wages could lead to a 1.12 per cent increase in the real PFCE and the multiplier effect of this could result in a 64 bps increase in the GDP growth. However, the data shows that the real wage growth of households belonging to the lower income bracket was marginally negative in Q2 of FY24, Ind-Ra said. On the other hand, the real wage growth of households belonging to the upper income bracket grew 6.4 per cent in Q2 of FY24. As a result, the current consumption demand is skewed in favour of the goods and services consumed largely by the households belonging to the upper income bracket, it said. Ind-Ra said sustained real wage growth of the households belonging to lower income bracket is an imperative for a sustainable and broad-based recovery in consumption demand.",Business,india rat raise fy gdp growth estimate india rat research indra revise upwards indias gross domestic product gdp growth estimate fy per cent earlier per cent cite number factor include resilience indian economy grow per cent second quarter fy accord indra factor boost growth sustain government capex deleveraged balance sheet corporatesbanking sector prospect new private corporate capex cycle sustain momentum business software service export couple remittances rest world despite global headwinds however say risk global growth world trade organization wto expect world merchandise trade volume grow per cent expect per cent however wto expect world merchandise trade volume grow per cent international monetary fund imf expect global growth slow per cent per cent lower prepandemic average growth per cent imf expect growth decline emerge market develop economies bps per cent per cent sharper advance economies bps per cent per cent say imf expect growth advance economies slow per cent monetary policy tighten pursue central bank countries continue bite however tighter monetary policies would translate global inflation decline per cent per cent per cent another risk may impact global growth trade especially disruptions supply chain volatile geopolitical situation baltic dry index jump sixquarter high qfy qfy say risk continue weigh restrict indias gdp growth per cent fy fy per cent quarterly gdp growth come per cent per cent q fy q fy respectively slat slow sequentially remain two quarter fy say sunil kumar sinha principal economist indra reserve bank india rbi also expect sequential slowdown gdp growth remain two quarter expect overall fy gdp come per cent national statistical office slat release first advance estimate gdp fy friday first advance estimate gdp obtain extrapolation data first seveneight months ongoing financial year fy release early help officer ministry finance departments frame broad contour union budget next financial year present parliament february indra expect private final consumption expenditure pfce grow per cent fy fy per cent pfce growth increase per cent q fy decline per cent q fy first half fy per centhowever pfce growth second half fy benefit base effect pfce growth h fy per cent therefore indra expect pfce hfy grow per cent say wage growth critical consumption growth indras calculation show per cent increase real wag could lead per cent increase real pfce multiplier effect could result bps increase gdp growth however data show real wage growth households belong lower income bracket marginally negative q fy indra say hand real wage growth households belong upper income bracket grow per cent q fy result current consumption demand skew favour goods service consume largely households belong upper income bracket say indra say sustain real wage growth households belong lower income bracket imperative sustainable broadbased recovery consumption demand,0
139,"Danger of cheap goods invading Indian markets, says Jaishankar","External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday called for greater use of locally manufactured products by Indian consumers at a time when cheap and highly subsidized imported items are “invading” Indian markets. India is trying to curb cheap quality imports from countries such as China with the use of several policy measures including quality control orders (QCOs). This comes as China continues to be India’s top import source with imports registering a 4 per cent jump to a record $98.51 billion in FY23. While India is dependent on imports of several items, most importantly, Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), trade with China lacks transparency. China’s exports to India have risen consistently but India’s export to China faces multiple non-tariff barriers resulting in a sharp decline over the years. “To me, particularly because there is a danger of cheap goods or subsidized goods invading our markets, we have to instill pride in the producer but also pride in the consumer. We must consciously say that we should make in India and buy in India and buy what is made in India,” Jaishankar said at the ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat Utsav celebration’ organised at Bharat Mandapam. On the importance of One District-One Product (ODOP), which aims to select, brand, and promote at least one product from each district, the minister said, “ODOP is part of our personality. This is very important because in the era of globalisation, various societies and cultures begin to lose their identity and personality”. Meanwhile, commerce minister Piyush Goyal said that India is not anti-imports. “The idea is not to close our doors or that imports are bad. We are not anti-import. Atmanirbhar Bharat also means we will also increase our exports and for that if we need to import, we will not stop those. We will leave India’s impression on the cost, competition, and quality front,” Goyal said. In 2023, India’s goods imports far outstripped the exports. Moreover, exports declined amid slowing global demand in the backdrop of demand slowdown in the west and in China, the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said. “Interestingly, this decrease in exports occurred despite a considerable depreciation in the Indian Rupee (INR) against the US Dollar (USD). Over the span of one year, the average INR/USD exchange rate had depreciated from 77.5 in June 2022 to 82.1 in June 2023. Normally, a weaker domestic currency can boost exports by making a country’s products more competitive in the global market. However, in India’s case, the depreciation of the INR did not translate into increased export volumes,” the think tank said. Notably, India’s efforts to push for local production and cut reliance on Chinese items has shown results in the electronic manufacturing sector. The imports of finished electronic products like computers, laptops, and other hardware showed a decline, dropping from $15.4 billion to $13.8 billion, a decrease of 10.3 per cent. Imports of electronic instruments also reduced slightly from $10.4 billion to $10.1 billion, a 2.3 per cent decline. These trends indicate the early successes of India’s Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, which aims to boost domestic manufacturing and reduce dependency on imported electronics. The decrease in imports of finished products and instruments, alongside the growth in exports, especially in smartphones, suggests a strengthening of India’s electronics manufacturing capabilities, GTRI said.",Business,danger cheap goods invade indian market say jaishankar external affairs minister jaishankar wednesday call greater use locally manufacture products indian consumers time cheap highly subsidize import items invade indian market india try curb cheap quality import countries china use several policy measure include quality control order qcos come china continue indias top import source import register per cent jump record billion fy india dependent import several items importantly active pharmaceutical ingredients apis trade china lack transparency chinas export india rise consistently indias export china face multiple nontariff barriers result sharp decline years particularly danger cheap goods subsidize goods invade market instill pride producer also pride consumer must consciously say make india buy india buy make india jaishankar say aatmanirbhar bharat utsav celebration organise bharat mandapam importance one districtone product odop aim select brand promote least one product district minister say odop part personality important era globalisation various societies culture begin lose identity personality meanwhile commerce minister piyush goyal say india antiimports idea close doors import bad antiimport atmanirbhar bharat also mean also increase export need import stop leave indias impression cost competition quality front goyal say indias goods import far outstrip export moreover export decline amid slow global demand backdrop demand slowdown west china global trade research initiative gtri say interestingly decrease export occur despite considerable depreciation indian rupee inr us dollar usd span one year average inrusd exchange rate depreciate june june normally weaker domestic currency boost export make countrys products competitive global market however indias case depreciation inr translate increase export volumes think tank say notably indias efforts push local production cut reliance chinese items show result electronic manufacture sector import finish electronic products like computers laptops hardware show decline drop billion billion decrease per cent import electronic instrument also reduce slightly billion billion per cent decline trend indicate early successes indias productionlinked incentive pli scheme aim boost domestic manufacture reduce dependency import electronics decrease import finish products instrument alongside growth export especially smartphones suggest strengthen indias electronics manufacture capabilities gtri say,0
140,EPFO extends deadline for employers to upload details of those opting higher pension,"The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) on Wednesday gave a five-month extension till May 31 for employers to upload wage details online for those opting for higher pension. At least 17.49 lakh applications for validation of option or joint option have been received from members till July 11, 2023, a Labour Ministry statement said. More than 3.6 lakh applications for validation of option or joint option are still pending with the employers for processing, it said. The EPFO had kept the deadline to apply for higher pensions till July 11. Following this, it gave further three months to employers till September 30 and then another extension till December 31, while employees were given time till July 11 to submit their applications. “In view of representations received from Employers & Employers’ Associations wherein requests were made to extend the time period for uploading wage details of applicant pensioners / members, the employers were also given a further period of three months to submit wage details etc. online latest by 30.09.2023. This time was further extended till 31.12.2023 because many representations were received from Employers & Employers’ Associations wherein requests were made to extend further time period for uploading wage details of applicant pensioners / members,” it said. The Supreme Court in a ruling on November 4, 2022 had upheld the amendments to the Employees’ Pension (Amendment) Scheme, 2014, providing another chance for employees who were existing EPS members as on September 1, 2014, to contribute up to 8.33 per cent of their ‘actual’ salaries — as against 8.33 per cent of the pensionable salary capped at Rs 15,000 a month — towards pension. Last month, in a circular to its field officers, the EPFO stated that the pensionable formula for those opting for higher pension will be calculated as per para 12 of the EPS and that “the date of commencement of pension will determine the applicable formula for calculation of pensionable service, pensionable salary and pension”. For those who will retire in the future, say in 2030, the EPFO said the pension will be calculated based on the provisions of EPS, 1995 that will “exist as on the date of the commencement of pension”. Though the FAQs stayed silent about any change in the pensionable formula, people in the know had said that there could be tweaks in the pensionable formula for those who retire in the future going ahead.",Business,epfo extend deadline employers upload detail opt higher pension employees provident fund organisation epfo wednesday give fivemonth extension till may employers upload wage detail online opt higher pension least lakh applications validation option joint option receive members till july labour ministry statement say lakh applications validation option joint option still pending employers process say epfo keep deadline apply higher pension till july follow give three months employers till september another extension till december employees give time till july submit applications view representations receive employers employers associations wherein request make extend time period upload wage detail applicant pensioners members employers also give period three months submit wage detail etc online latest time extend till many representations receive employers employers associations wherein request make extend time period upload wage detail applicant pensioners members say supreme court rule november uphold amendments employees pension amendment scheme provide another chance employees exist eps members september contribute per cent actual salaries per cent pensionable salary cap rs month towards pension last month circular field officer epfo state pensionable formula opt higher pension calculate per para eps date commencement pension determine applicable formula calculation pensionable service pensionable salary pension retire future say epfo say pension calculate base provision eps exist date commencement pension though faqs stay silent change pensionable formula people know say could tweak pensionable formula retire future go ahead,0
141,India is chasing China’s economy. But something is holding it back,"India’s economy is booming. Stock prices are through the roof, among the best performing in the world. The government’s investment in airports, bridges and roads, and clean-energy infrastructure is visible almost everywhere. India’s total output, or gross domestic product, is expected to increase 6% this year — faster than the United States or China. But there’s a hitch: Investment by Indian companies is not keeping pace. The money that companies put into the future of their businesses, for things like new machines and factories, is stagnant. As a fraction of India’s economy, it is shrinking. And while money is flying into India’s stock markets, long-term investment from overseas has been declining. Green and red lights are flashing at the same time. At some point soon, the government will need to reduce its extraordinary spending, which could weigh on the economy if private sector money doesn’t pick up. No one expects India to stop growing, but a rise of 6% is not enough to meet India’s ambitions. Its population, now the world’s biggest, is growing. Its government has set a national goal of catching up to China and becoming a developed nation by 2047. That kind of leap will require sustained growth closer to 8% or 9% a year, most economists say. The missing investment could also present a challenge for Narendra Modi, the prime minister since 2014, who has concentrated on making India an easier place for foreign and Indian companies to do business. Modi is in campaign mode, facing elections in the spring and rallying the nation to cheer his successes. The sluggish investment is not something executives, bankers or foreign diplomats like to discuss, for fear of looking like naysayers. But investors are playing it safe while the economy is signaling both strengths and weaknesses. One point of widespread agreement is that India should benefit from China’s slowdown, which has been fueled by an unfolding property crisis. China’s geopolitical tensions with the West present another opening for India, by motivating foreign companies to move production in China to other countries. Sriram Viswanathan, an Indian-born managing partner at Celesta, a Silicon Valley venture capital fund, describes investors “wanting to fill the vacuum that has been created in the supply chain.” “That, I think, is the opportunity for India,” he said. The World Bank has applauded India’s commitment to infrastructure spending, which ramped up during the pandemic when the private sector needed rescuing. Since then, the government has doubled down, paying for bricks-and-mortar improvement to the rickety roads, ports and power supply that once discouraged business investment. But the World Bank, whose mission is to nudge developing economies higher, says it is critical that those billions’ worth of government spending ignite a burst of corporate spending. Its economists speak of a “crowd-in effect,” which happens when, for instance, a new port next to a shiny new industrial park lures companies into building plants and hiring workers. Last year, the bank said it anticipated an imminent crowding-in, as it has forecast for almost three years running. “To accelerate the growth of confidence, public investment is not enough,” Auguste Tano Kouamé, the World Bank’s country director for India, said at a news conference in April. “You need deeper reforms to make the private sector invest.” A lack of confidence helps explain why the stock markets are setting records, even while foreign investors are backing away from buying into the Indian economy through startups and acquisitions. The stock markets in Mumbai, India’s business capital, are worth nearly $4 trillion, up from $3 trillion a year ago, making them more valuable than Hong Kong’s. India’s small investors have been a big part of that, but trading stocks is quick and easy, compared with buying and selling companies. A recent annual average of $40 billion in foreign direct investment has shrunk to $13 billion in the past year. One reason that businesses are watching and waiting to make investments is Modi’s powerful national government. On the one hand, business craves stability in political leadership, and India has rarely, if ever, had such a well-entrenched leader. He demolished the main opposition party in three big elections across the Hindi-speaking heartland in December and looks like a shoo-in for reelection this year. And Modi is vocally pro-business. His government plays a markedly interventionist role in managing the economy, in a way that can make it dangerous for firms to place their stakes. In August, the government announced sudden restrictions on the import of laptop computers, to spur production at home. That sent businesses that depend on them into a tailspin, and the measure was almost as suddenly withdrawn. Likewise in July, the government slapped online betting companies with a retroactive 28% tax, gutting a $1.5 billion industry overnight. Businesses close to Modi and his political circle have done especially well. The most prominent examples are Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries and the Adani Group, conglomerates that reach into numerous areas of Indian life. Their combined market power has grown gigantic in recent years: The flagship stocks of each company are worth about six times more than they were when Modi became prime minister. Some smaller companies have been the target of high-profile raids by tax-enforcement agencies. “If you’re not the two A’s” — Adani or Ambani — it can be treacherous to navigate India’s regulatory byways, said Arvind Subramanian, an economist at Brown University who served under Modi’s government as chief economic adviser from 2014 to 2018. “Domestic investors feel a little bit vulnerable,” he added. The past nine years of Modi government have improved many things in the business environment for all. Crucial systems work better, many types of corruption have been reined in and digitization of commerce has opened up new arenas for growth. “What is really complex and interesting about this Modi phenomenon is that there’s a lot of hype and bluster and manipulation,” Subramanian said. “But it’s built on a core of achievement.” Still, foreign officials charged with bringing billions of investment capital to India complain that much of the traditional pain of doing business in India lingers. The one most frequently cited is red tape. Too many officials get involved at every level of approval, and it remains painfully slow to obtain legal judgments, let alone to enforce them. Another factor holding back longer-term investment is an underlying weakness in “the India growth story.” The most powerful source of demand, the kind that foreign investors and domestic businesses covet, is among the wealthiest consumers. In a population of 1.4 billion, about 20 million Indians are doing well enough to buy European consumer products, build luxury homes and beef up the top tier of the automotive sector. Most of the rest of the population is struggling with inflation in food and fuel prices. Banks are extending credit to consumers of both kinds, but less so to businesses, which fear that the great majority of their customers will be tightening their belts for years to come. “For the moment, there is no evidence that investors are feeling reassured about India,” Subramanian said. But he remains hopeful. The annual growth, even if less than 6%, is nothing to sniff at. The new and improved infrastructure should attract more private investment eventually. And the benefits of consumer wealth, unevenly distributed as they are, could over time raise up more incomes. The biggest wild card is whether India can grab a significant share of global business from China. The highest-profile example is Apple, the $3 trillion megacompany, which is slowly moving some of its supply chain away from China. Its pricey iPhone has barely 5% of the Indian market. But currently about 7% of the world’s iPhones are made in India — and JPMorgan Chase has estimated that Apple intends to get that to 25% by 2025. At that point, all kinds of things become possible for India. “We should keep our minds open,” Subramanian said.",Business,india chase chinas economy something hold back indias economy boom stock

142,India’s Akasa Air nears order for 150 Boeing jets: Report,"Indian budget carrier Akasa Air is set to close an order for around 150 Boeing 737 MAX narrowbody planes, two sources said, its latest bid to tap the travel boom in the world’s fastest-growing aviation market. Contract negotiations are ongoing and a deal is expected to be announced at Wings India, the country’s largest civil aviation event scheduled for Jan. 18-21, said the two sources familiar with the ongoing talks. An Akasa spokesperson said the airline does not comment on speculation, while Boeing did not respond to Reuters’ queries. The sources declined to be named as the plane order details are confidential. Reuters is first to report details of the deal, which comes on top of Akasa’s existing order book for 76 Boeing 737 MAX planes. Akasa is India’s newest airline and has garnered market share of 4% since it started flying in 2022, against IndiGo’s 60% and Tata Group airlines’ combined 26%. Its Chief Commercial Officer Praveen Iyer told Indian newspaper Business Line in December that Akasa planned to announce a three-digit aircraft order in early 2024, without sharing any details. The first source said its new order for around 150 planes is likely to include some future purchasing options. The airline currently flies only domestically, with a fleet of around two dozen planes. It was hit last year by the abrupt departure of about a tenth of its pilots and had warned it was flying less as a result, costing it market share. It has since said the issue is behind it. Both sources said Akasa’s new plane order is aimed at fuelling its domestic and international expansion, with the narrowbody Boeing planes being ordered equipped to fly to nearby foreign destinations like Southeast Asia and the Middle East from India. Indian carriers are trying to keep pace with soaring demand for air travel which has surged post-COVID, sending industry records tumbling amid diminishing production slots even as plane manufacturers are struggling to meet output goals. IndiGo in June placed a record order for 500 Airbus narrowbody planes, eclipsing Air India’s purchase of 470 combined jets from Airbus and Boeing earlier in the year. Akasa’s order will be another win for Boeing, which has been lagging behind Airbus in the fast-growing Indian market, where its other customers include SpiceJet.",Business,indias akasa air near order boeing jet report indian budget carrier akasa air set close order around boeing max narrowbody plan two source say latest bid tap travel boom worlds fastestgrowing aviation market contract negotiations ongoing deal expect announce wing india countrys largest civil aviation event schedule jan say two source familiar ongoing talk akasa spokesperson say airline comment speculation boeing respond reuters query source decline name plane order detail confidential reuters first report detail deal come top akasas exist order book boeing max plan akasa indias newest airline garner market share since start fly indigos tata group airlines combine chief commercial officer praveen iyer tell indian newspaper business line december akasa plan announce threedigit aircraft order early without share detail first source say new order around plan likely include future purchase options airline currently fly domestically fleet around two dozen plan hit last year abrupt departure tenth pilot warn fly less result cost market share since say issue behind source say akasas new plane order aim fuel domestic international expansion narrowbody boeing plan order equip fly nearby foreign destinations like southeast asia middle east india indian carriers try keep pace soar demand air travel surge postcovid send industry record tumble amid diminish production slot even plane manufacturers struggle meet output goals indigo june place record order airbus narrowbody plan eclipse air indias purchase combine jet airbus boeing earlier year akasas order another win boeing lag behind airbus fastgrowing indian market customers include spicejet,0
143,Rupee falls 11 paise to close at 83.32 against US dollar,"The rupee depreciated by 11 paise to 83.32 (provisional) against the US dollar on Tuesday, amid a muted trend in domestic equities and dollar demand from importers. Forex traders said foreign fund outflows and dollar demand from importers weighed on investor sentiments.
At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local unit opened at 83.28 and finally settled at 83.32 (provisional) against the dollar, down by 11 paise from its previous close. On Monday, the rupee depreciated by 5 paise to 83.21 against the US dollar, in the first trading session of the year 2024. The dollar index, which gauges the greenback’s strength against a basket of six currencies, was 0.11 per cent up at 101.44 on Tuesday. Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, was trading higher by 2.13 per cent to USD 78.68 per barrel. On the domestic equity market front, Sensex declined 379.46 points, or 0.53 per cent, to settle at 71,892.48 points. The Nifty fell 76.10 points, or 0.35 per cent, to 21,665.80 points. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) were net sellers in the capital markets on Monday as they offloaded shares worth Rs 855.80 crore, according to exchange data. The Indian rupee depreciated by 0.14 per cent on weak domestic markets and a positive US dollar. Surge in crude oil prices also weighed on rupee. US dollar rose on safe haven appeal amid geopolitical tensions in the Red Sea and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, according to Anuj Choudhary, Research Analyst, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. “We expect the rupee to trade with a negative bias on weak domestic equities and a rise in the US dollar. Surge in crude oil prices may also weigh on the domestic currency. However, any FII outflows may support rupee at lower levels,” Choudhary added. Choudhary further noted that traders may take cues from final manufacturing PMI and construction spending data from the US. “Traders may await manufacturing index data from India and ISM manufacturing PMI and JOLTS jobs data from the US tomorrow. USD-INR spot price is expected to trade in a range of 83.10 to 83.70,” he added. On the domestic macroeconomic front, GST collections rose 10 per cent to about Rs 1.64 lakh crore in December compared to Rs 1.49 lakh crore in the same month a year ago. During April-December 2023, gross Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection witnessed a robust 12 per cent growth, reaching Rs 14.97 lakh crore against Rs 13.40 lakh crore mopped up in the same period of the previous year, the finance ministry said in a statement on Monday.",Business,rupee fall paise close us dollar rupee depreciate paise provisional us dollar tuesday amid mute trend domestic equities dollar demand importers forex traders say foreign fund outflows dollar demand importers weigh investor sentimentsat interbank foreign exchange market local unit open finally settle provisional dollar paise previous close monday rupee depreciate paise us dollar first trade session year dollar index gauge greenbacks strength basket six currencies per cent tuesday brent crude futures global oil benchmark trade higher per cent usd per barrel domestic equity market front sensex decline point per cent settle point nifty fell point per cent point foreign institutional investors fiis net sellers capital market monday offload share worth rs crore accord exchange data indian rupee depreciate per cent weak domestic market positive us dollar surge crude oil price also weigh rupee us dollar rise safe appeal amid geopolitical tensions red sea ongoing conflict middle east accord anuj choudhary research analyst sharekhan bnp paribas expect rupee trade negative bias weak domestic equities rise us dollar surge crude oil price may also weigh domestic currency however fii outflows may support rupee lower level choudhary add choudhary note traders may take cue final manufacture pmi construction spend data us traders may await manufacture index data india ism manufacture pmi jolt job data us tomorrow usdinr spot price expect trade range add domestic macroeconomic front gst collections rise per cent rs lakh crore december compare rs lakh crore month year ago aprildecember gross goods service tax gst collection witness robust per cent growth reach rs lakh crore rs lakh crore mop period previous year finance ministry say statement monday,0

Sun Pharma, Bajaj Finance, Bharti Airtel, Reliance Industries, Bajaj Finserv and Titan were among the winners. The market extended yesterday’s last hour’s sell-off, taking negative cues from Asian peers due to weak Chinese manufacturing data and mounting tensions in the Red Sea, which has the potential to disrupt global trade and crude supplies,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said. “Ahead of the impending results season, investors are adopting a profit booking strategy. Auto stocks declined on below-expected volume numbers, while pharma stocks were the standout due to catch-up in the US economy,” Nair added.

146,No longer looking at import duties as revenue source in FTA negotiations: Official,"India is likely to lower tariffs on a range of items including high tariff products such as cars, whiskey and machinery items for the first time under the free trade agreements (FTAs) with developed economies and is moving away from looking at tariffs as a source of revenue during negotiations, a government official said. This comes amid internal consultations between the finance ministry and the commerce ministry to assess the impact of the major duty reductions that could be announced as part of the FTAs. India is currently negotiating FTAs with the UK, the European Union(EU), Australia and Oman, and India could lower duties on goods and services sharply. “Things are moving in the direction where tariffs cannot be a source of revenue. Tariffs contribute to revenue but a free trade agreement cannot be accessed on the basis of tariffs because when free movement of goods and services happen, the overall economic growth is immense. Revenue will be a minor part of the whole story,” the official said on the condition of anonymity. Tariffs are customs duties on goods imported into a country. New Delhi has the highest import duty compared to most major economies with an average Most Favored Nation (MFN) rate of 18 per cent, about twice the global average, according to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Tariff Profile database. In trade parlance, the most-favored-nation clause requires WTO members to offer the same trade terms to all trading partners. The union government estimates to receive Rs 2.3 lakh crore in revenue from custom duty in 2023-24, about 11 per cent higher compared to the 2022-23 revised estimates of Rs 2.1 lakh crore according to the official figures. Customs duties contribute about 8 per cent of the gross tax revenue. The total import tax collection in 2021-22 stood at Rs 1.99 lakh crore. “India is a high tariff economy. Even if you see the major South Asean countries or the global landscape, the average tariff has gone pretty down. There is a tendency to remove tariff barriers across the globe. It is because of global value chain integration and India is also doing that with the help of free trade agreements, the official said. As part of the UK FTA, India is contemplating a reduction in duty for the imports of Scotch whisky from the UK that attracts a 150 per cent and slash tariffs on automobiles that stands at 100 per cent. Under the partial trade deal signed with Australia, India had lowered duty for Australian wines for the first time. The official said that the opening up of the economy will be undertaken in a calibrated manner and that the commerce ministry is consulting with the finance ministry over the revenue implications. “We are looking for more competition, quality and consumer benefits in the economy are moving away from protectionism,” the official added. High tariffs are among the key concerns raised by trade partners India is negotiating FTA with. The simple average tariff on goods imported into the UK from India is 4.2 per cent but the simple average tariffs on UK exports to India was 14.6 per cent, UK’s department of international trade said in a report on India. India has raised duty even on intermediate and capital goods that are used in the manufacturing process which is higher than competitors such as Vietnam and Indonesia. In the last decade, India’s trade-weighted average MFN rate jumped from 7.7 per cent to 11.4 per cent, while the global average decreased from 7.5 per cent to 6.9 per cent, MVIRDC World Trade Center said in a report. The report added that duties imposed on capital goods such as electrical machinery, non-electrical machinery and transport equipment  are also higher compared to the global average. High tariffs have also been flagged by the US trade ministry saying that India’s tariff regime has large disparities between bound rates and the most favored nation (MFN) applied rates charged at the border. US exporters face “tremendous uncertainty because India has considerable flexibility to change tariff rates at any time”, the US Trade Representative said. “India’s trade regime and regulatory environment remains relatively restrictive. Technical barriers to trade (TBT), sanitary and phyto-sanitary (SPS) measures, deviation from internationally-agreed standards, as well as discrimination based on legislative or administrative measures by India, affect a wide range of sectors, including goods, services, public procurement and investment,” European Union said on trade with India.",Business,longer look import duties revenue source fta negotiations official india likely lower tariff range items include high tariff products cars whiskey machinery items first time free trade agreements ftas develop economies move away look tariff source revenue negotiations government official say come amid internal consultations finance ministry commerce ministry assess impact major duty reductions could announce part ftas india currently negotiate ftas uk european unioneu australia oman india could lower duties goods service sharply things move direction tariff cannot source revenue tariff contribute revenue free trade agreement cannot access basis tariff free movement goods service happen overall economic growth immense revenue minor part whole story official say condition anonymity tariff customs duties goods import country new delhi highest import duty compare major economies average favor nation mfn rate per cent twice global average accord world trade organization wto tariff profile database trade parlance mostfavorednation clause require wto members offer trade term trade partner union government estimate receive rs lakh crore revenue custom duty per cent higher compare revise estimate rs lakh crore accord official figure customs duties contribute per cent gross tax revenue total import tax collection stand rs lakh crore india high tariff economy even see major south asean countries global landscape average tariff go pretty tendency remove tariff barriers across globe global value chain integration india also help free trade agreements official say part uk fta india contemplate reduction duty import scotch whisky uk attract per cent slash tariff automobile stand per cent partial trade deal sign australia india lower duty australian win first time official say open economy undertake calibrate manner commerce ministry consult finance ministry revenue implications look competition quality consumer benefit economy move away protectionism official add high tariff among key concern raise trade partner india negotiate fta simple average tariff goods import uk india per cent simple average tariff uk export india per cent uks department international trade say report india india raise duty even intermediate capital goods use manufacture process higher competitors vietnam indonesia last decade indias tradeweighted average mfn rate jump per cent per cent global average decrease per cent per cent mvirdc world trade center say report report add duties impose capital goods electrical machinery nonelectrical machinery transport equipment also higher compare global average high tariff also flag us trade ministry say indias tariff regime large disparities bind rat favor nation mfn apply rat charge border us exporters face tremendous uncertainty india considerable flexibility change tariff rat time us trade representative say indias trade regime regulatory environment remain relatively restrictive technical barriers trade tbt sanitary phytosanitary sps measure deviation internationallyagreed standards well discrimination base legislative administrative measure india affect wide range sectors include goods service public procurement investment european union say trade india,0
147,"Houthi threat notwithstanding, it’s smooth sailing for Russian oil through Red Sea","The recent spate of attacks on commercial vessels by Yemen-based Houthi rebels have not impacted flow of Russian crude through the Suez Canal-Red Sea route, even as a number of global shipping lines and oil companies are now avoiding the important global trade artery. Tankers carrying Russian crude have not rerouted, and even the fresh cargoes leaving Russian ports are sticking to the Red Sea route to reach Asia, instead of going all the way around Africa via the Cape of Good Hope, as per data from commodity market analytics firm Kpler. Russian oil cargoes departing from the North Sea and Black Sea ports take the Suez Canal-Red Sea route to reach Asia, specifically India and China, which are currently the biggest buyers of Russian crude. Oil and shipping analysts do not foresee tankers carrying Russian oil coming under attack in the region as Russia is perceived as Iran’s ally. The Houthi rebels are widely believed to be backed by Tehran. “So far, it appears to be clear that Russian cargoes have a kind of safe passage through the Red Sea. They have been largely immune to the crisis and given the equation between Iran and Russia, it is likely to stay that way. It would be a surprise if the Houthis go after Russian oil passing through the region,” an oil market analyst said on condition of anonymity. Data on India’s December crude oil imports corroborates the lack of impact of the Red Sea crisis on Russian oil flows. Volumes of Urals crude—the mainstay of India’s Russian oil imports—received by Indian refiners in December were in the same range as the previous few months, as per Kpler data. Urals crude accounts for about three-fourths of India’s Russian oil imports and is transported to India via the Suez Canal-Red Sea route. Over the past few weeks, a number of cargo ships have come under attack from the Houthi rebels around the Bab al-Mandab strait, which leads to the Red Sea and Suez Canal, forming the shortest, albeit narrow, route to the Mediterranean Sea and beyond from the Arab Peninsula, North-East Africa, and the Arabian Sea. The route is seen as an important artery of global goods and energy supplies. The Houthis have so far claimed that they are targetting vessels with links to Israel in view of its military offensive in Gaza. Prior to December, the Suez Canal and the Red Sea accounted for around 10 per cent of global crude oil flows and 14 per cent of petroleum product flows. But as a number of major shipping companies are now avoiding the route, choosing instead to go around the African continent via the Cape of Good Hope, the share of global oil and petroleum product flows passing through the Suez Canal has dropped significantly. Russian crude, however, stands out as an exception. “Crude oil transits through the Suez Canal were 1.86 million bpd (barrels per day) in December, the lowest number since January 2022, which was also the last month before the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Before that, Russian oil sailing to India was a rare phenomenon,” said Viktor Katona, Kpler’s Lead Crude Analyst. He added that Russian oil cargoes are accounting for nearly half of the crude oil transiting through the Suez Canal. According to the United States (US) Energy Information Administration (EIA), southbound shipments through the Suez Canal rose significantly between 2021 and 2023, largely because of Western sanctions on Russia’s oil exports. “Oil exports from Russia accounted for 74 per cent of Suez southbound oil traffic in the first half of 2023, up from 30% in 2021. Most of those export volumes were destined for India and China, which imported mostly crude oil from Russia,” the EIA said in December. In the aftermath of the war in Ukraine, as Western sanctions on Russia altered global crude oil flows, India and China emerged as the biggest buyers of Russian crude, accounting for most of Moscow’s oil exports. Prior to the war in Ukraine, Russia was a marginal player in India’s oil imports. However, as the West began shunning Russian oil following Moscow’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Russia started offering deep discounts on its oil to willing buyers. Indian refiners started lapping up the discounted barrels, catapulting Russia to the top spot on the list of India’s oil suppliers.

148,"High tariffs among reasons behind weak exports, says GTRI","The reasons behind India’s weaker export performance include higher tariffs in India and lower tariffs in its FTA partner countries, think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said in a report on Monday. “Many Indian firms choose not to use the FTA route when import duties are low, as FTA-related compliance costs do not justify the tariff benefits. For instance, in the case of India’s FTA partners, many imports occur at zero or low Most Favored Nation (MFN) duties,” the report said. Conversely, India has higher import duties, so eliminating these duties under FTAs gives a price advantage to products from FTA partner countries, GTRI said. The tariff discrepancy was among the factors why India’s three key Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with ASEAN, South Korea, and Japan were not successful as per the think tank which resulted in India’s merchandise trade deficit with these partners increased significantly more than its global trade deficit. “Specifically, the deficits grew by 302.9% with ASEAN, 164.1% with South Korea, and 138.2% with Japan, compared to a 81.2% increase in the global deficit. This comparison is based on data from the pre-FTA period (2007-09) and recent trade data (2020-22),” the report stated. Second, India’s exports to these FTA partners have increased at a lower rate than its imports. For instance, with ASEAN, exports grew by 123.9% and imports by 175.7%; with Japan, exports grew by 56.4% and imports by 98.5%; and with South Korea, exports increased by 89.1% and imports by 127.3%, it said.",Business,high tariff among reason behind weak export say gtri reason behind indias weaker export performance include higher tariff india lower tariff fta partner countries think tank global trade research initiative gtri say report monday many indian firm choose use fta route import duties low ftarelated compliance cost justify tariff benefit instance case indias fta partner many import occur zero low favor nation mfn duties report say conversely india higher import duties eliminate duties ftas give price advantage products fta partner countries gtri say tariff discrepancy among factor indias three key free trade agreements ftas asean south korea japan successful per think tank result indias merchandise trade deficit partner increase significantly global trade deficit specifically deficits grow asean south korea japan compare increase global deficit comparison base data prefta period recent trade data report state second indias export fta partner increase lower rate import instance asean export grow import japan export grow import south korea export increase import say,0
149,Gross GST collections drop to three-month low of Rs 1.64 lakh crore in December,"The Gross Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections declined to a three-month low of Rs 1.64 lakh crore in December (for sales in November), data released by the Finance Ministry on Monday showed. Though year-on-year growth of 10.3 per cent was registered in December, the pace of growth in GST collections was also the slowest in three months. Earlier, a pickup in consumption and economic activity along with settlement of disputes by businesses following notices issued by GST authorities were seen to have contributed to the sharp rise in GST revenue, which has now moderated despite early-November having marked the festival season. The impact of lower imports is likely to have contributed to the decline in GST revenues. GST collections had surged 15.1 per cent to Rs 1.67 lakh crore in November and 13.4 per cent in October at Rs 1.72 lakh crore, the second-highest level since the July 2017 rollout of the indirect tax regime. With the latest print, GST revenue collections have averaged at Rs 1.66 lakh crore per month during April-December 2023, up 11.7 per cent from the monthly average of Rs 1.50 lakh crore seen during April-December 2022. “During the April-December 2023 period, gross GST collection witnessed a robust 12% y-o-y growth, reaching Rs 14.97 lakh crore, as against Rs 13.40 lakh crore collected in the same period of the previous year (April-December 2022),” the ministry said in its statement. Seven states/union territories out of 38 states/UTs (including Centre’s jurisdiction) recorded single-digit growth in GST collections. There was a marked sequential slowdown in revenue collection in states such as Gujarat, which collected Rs 9,874 crore in December, up 7 per cent from Rs 9,238 crore in the year-ago period but lower than Rs 10,853 crore collected in November 2023. Similarly, GST collections grew in single digit for Chhattisgarh (1 per cent) at Rs 2,613 crore, Punjab (8 per cent) at Rs 1,875 crore, Rajasthan (1 per cent) at Rs 3,828 crore, and Himachal Pradesh (5 per cent) at Rs 745 crore. Strife-torn Manipur posted a positive growth of 9 per cent to Rs 50 crore in GST revenue collections in December after being in the negative territory in the previous month. Maharashtra, which accounts for the largest share in GST revenue collections, too recorded a moderation in the year-on-year growth at 14 per cent in December as against 18 per cent in November. In absolute terms, however, the GST revenue collection in Maharashtra increased to Rs 26,814 crore in December from Rs 25,585 crore in November and Rs 23,598 crore in the year-ago period. “While major states have continued their growth, deeper analysis is required for the lack of growth in GST collections in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand,” MS Mani, Partner, Deloitte India said. Post-settlement SGST revenue, which accounts for SGST revenue and the share of SGST from the IGST for states/UTs, totalled at Rs 6.39 lakh crore during April-December, an increase of 12 per cent from the year-ago period. Overall, the total GST collections stood at Rs 1,64,882 crore in December, out of which Central GST — the tax levied on intra-state supplies of goods and services by the Centre — was Rs 30,443 crore, State GST — the tax levied on intra-state supplies of goods and services by the states — was Rs 37,935 crore, Integrated GST — the tax levied on all inter-state supplies of goods and services — was Rs 84,255 crore (including Rs 41,534 crore collected on import of goods) and cess was Rs 12,249 crore (including Rs 1,079 crore collected on import of goods). Revenues from domestic transactions (including import of services) were 13 per cent higher than revenues from these sources during the same month last year, the ministry said in its statement. In December, the government settled Rs 40,057 crore to Central GST and Rs 33,652 crore to State GST from Integrated GST. As a result, the total revenue for the month post settlement was Rs 70,501 crore for the Centre and Rs 71,587 crore for State GST. With many businesses opting for settlement of disputes through some payments following the recent spate of notices sent by the GST authorities for recovery of non-payment of tax or underpayment or of wrongful availment of input tax credit, some payments by businesses would have been added to the overall GST revenue collection. Abhishek Jain, Partner & National Head, Indirect Tax, KPMG said, “While the collection is slightly lower than those seen last month, the consistent mark of above Rs 1.6 lakh crore provides large fiscal confidence; this being despite the various global headwinds. Festive cheer and continued settlement of FY 17-18 and 18-19 dues would have contributed well to this continued growth.” Vivek Jalan, Partner, Tax Connect Advisory, said, “…the efficiency of Government tax machinery is calculated by the tax buoyancy generated…considering an inflation of 5.5 per cent and GDP growth of 6.5 per cent, a growth in GST revenues by 12 per cent just around matches the real economic growth. It means that there is nil tax buoyancy as of now. With multiple years assessments and show cause notices getting time barred in the current FY, possibly the Ministries at Centre and states would be expecting that some buoyancy be generated by the tax administration.”",Business,gross gst collections drop threemonth low rs lakh crore december gross goods service tax gst collections decline threemonth low rs lakh crore december sales november data release finance ministry monday show though yearonyear growth per cent register december pace growth gst collections also slowest three months earlier pickup consumption economic activity along settlement dispute businesses follow notice issue gst authorities see contribute sharp rise gst revenue moderate despite earlynovember mark festival season impact lower import likely contribute decline gst revenues gst collections surge per cent rs lakh crore november per cent october rs lakh crore secondhighest level since july rollout indirect tax regime latest print gst revenue collections average rs lakh crore per month aprildecember per cent monthly average rs lakh crore see aprildecember aprildecember period gross gst collection witness robust yoy growth reach rs lakh crore rs lakh crore collect period previous year aprildecember ministry say statement seven statesunion territories statesuts include centre jurisdiction record singledigit growth gst collections mark sequential slowdown revenue collection state gujarat collect rs crore december per cent rs crore yearago period lower rs crore collect november similarly gst collections grow single digit chhattisgarh per cent rs crore punjab per cent rs crore rajasthan per cent rs crore himachal pradesh per cent rs crore strifetorn manipur post positive growth per cent rs crore gst revenue collections december negative territory previous month maharashtra account largest share gst revenue collections record moderation yearonyear growth per cent december per cent november absolute term however gst revenue collection maharashtra increase rs crore december rs crore november rs crore yearago period major state continue growth deeper analysis require lack growth gst collections rajasthan chhattisgarh jharkhand ms mani partner deloitte india say postsettlement sgst revenue account sgst revenue share sgst igst statesuts total rs lakh crore aprildecember increase per cent yearago period overall total gst collections stand rs crore december central gst tax levy intrastate supply goods service centre rs crore state gst tax levy intrastate supply goods service state rs crore integrate gst tax levy interstate supply goods service rs crore include rs crore collect import goods cess rs crore include rs crore collect import goods revenues domestic transactions include import service per cent higher revenues source month last year ministry say statement december government settle rs crore central gst rs crore state gst integrate gst result total revenue month post settlement rs crore centre rs crore state gst many businesses opt settlement dispute payments follow recent spate notice send gst authorities recovery nonpayment tax underpayment wrongful availment input tax credit payments businesses would add overall gst revenue collection abhishek jain partner national head indirect tax kpmg say collection slightly lower see last month consistent mark rs lakh crore provide large fiscal confidence despite various global headwinds festive cheer continue settlement fy dues would contribute well continue growth vivek jalan partner tax connect advisory say efficiency government tax machinery calculate tax buoyancy generatedconsidering inflation per cent gdp growth per cent growth gst revenues per cent around match real economic growth mean nil tax buoyancy multiple years assessments show cause notice get time bar current fy possibly ministries centre state would expect buoyancy generate tax administration,0

154,"India vs South Africa, Cape Town Test: Lessons from 23-wicket Day – How not to bat in Tests","What’s the best thing to have happened to India on a day when they lost 6 wickets for zero runs? That South Africa batted worse in their first innings to be shot out for 55 and had yielded a 98-run lead on a dramatic day’s play that could prove the difference in the end. South Africa continued their woeful ways in the second, losing three wickets and trailing by 36 runs. The pessimists would identify this run-difference to India’s total from that Pink ball Test during the 2020 Australia tour, but surely India can’t implode again? The day, however, was perfect to rant about the falling standards of Test batting. First, there was Pakistan’s shenanigans on a flat track pre-dawn in Australia before a tailender rescued them. This was followed by South Africa’s implosion in the afternoon before India sealed it by spontaneously combusting in the evening. There was unintentional dark humour too. Soon after the innings’s turning point – KL Rahul getting possessed by a mysterious force to swipe at a Lungi Ngidi short ball to make it 153 for 5 in the first ball of the 34th over – Virat Kohli had got involved in the game. He shepherded the incoming batsman Ravindra Jadeja, while muttering a string of instructions. Jadeja lasted 2 balls, stabbing a Ngidi bouncer to gully. Kohli then went a long way to usher in Jasprit Bumrah, once again he constantly chatted with the newcomer. Bumrah also lasted 2 balls, undone by a kicker that burst off his bat splice. Then Kohli turned his attention to Mohammad Siraj. In four balls, he had spoken to three teammates; no one can say he was alone in the middle and lacked some company. There were no Kohli conversations to be had further as Kagiso Rabada packed him for the fifth time in Tests with a lifter from back of length that induced a hard push and an edge to the slips. Wickets fell like nine pins! 🎳 .@mdsirajofficial & Co. were on the target this morning, snapping up all 10 #SouthAfrica wickets in just the first session of the Test! Watch all the fall of wickets here! Tune-in to #SAvIND 2nd Test
LIVE NOW | Star Sports Network#Cricket pic.twitter.com/viu3OGxCL8 — Star Sports (@StarSportsIndia) January 3, 2024 Until Rahul’s decision, Ngidi had a relatively ordinary day, with Shaun Pollock sighing about his lack of match practice. Everything would change in a Cape Town minute for him, for South Africa, for India, and for the fans. A game-turning triple strike in an over. There was one telling statistic that told the story of the two batting units. Despite numerous shouts and DRS reviews, there was no lbw dismissal in the 23 wickets that fell. It spoke about the bounce on the pitch – the main devil, really – but it also showed how the techniques have withered away. And perhaps some cricketing intelligence as well. Those numbers tell that batsmen could have been leaving the balls on a length, not easy but not improbable but made to seem impossible by the relentless plonking on the front foot without a second plan. There was some irony in their unceasing surprise at the extra bounce that kept ramming into their bat splice. Of the two teams, only one batsman – Tony de Zorzi in the first innings – showed that balls can be left on length. Anything slightly short of good length was flying over, but modern-day cricket has taken away many nuances. Not many leave on lengths, not many have a compact backfoot play, and the results shouldn’t surprise anyone. It was a day for Justin Langer-like leaves off lengths where he would withdraw his bat and watch the ball sail over the middle stump. Or the doggedness of a Steve Waugh or India’s current coach Rahul Dravid, showing the skill and the gumption to stand on their toes and nullify the bounce, taking a few body blows along the way. There weren’t short balls necessarily to be cut or even to pull unless one is Ricky Ponting. It needed dare, skill, gumption, and the ability to adapt – but it wasn’t part of the ticketed fare at the ground in the shadow of a mountain. Two Indian batsmen saved the day, Rohit Sharma and Kohli. Rohit primarily because the bowling at that point, barring Rabada, was erratic but he had the sense of mind and purpose to cash in. The best innings belonged to Kohli who these days blends aggression without boiling over in intensity as he could do. He was relatively relaxed, smiling with Elgar, mimicking a run of a South African on the field, chatting with the umpires. He would cuss himself a couple of times, at scoring opportunities lost as he realised its importance on such a pitch. There was a sequence of shots in the 27th over of the innings against Rabada that captured the essence of his knock. He pounced on a slightly short ball to unfurl a glorious one-legged pull, a shot that he doesn’t play too often. He usually swat-pulls with his bottom-handed wrist taking over but this was as conventional a pull he has unfurled. A couple of balls later, he creamed a gorgeous cover drive right out of the trademark Kohli gif and soon strode forward for an immaculate defense that brought Dravid to mind. It was all soon to change, though as a 43-run partnership in just over 10 overs ended with Rahul’s impulsive decision to counterattack after he had anaesthetised over 30 balls for 8 runs. Perhaps the pulled four in the previous over from Rabada had emboldened him. Maybe. The younger Indians were served a harsh crash course about the physics of the bouncing ball. Yashasvi Jaiswal defended a rising ball and on Indian pitches, it would have fallen near his toes, but here the ball hit the bat harder and rolled back to fall on the stumps. Shubman Gill, whose weight transfer has been an issue in Test cricket, was trying to press back but couldn’t do it in time. He was stuck there in an internet-loss buffering video, but the ball had rammed into his bat splice and swallowed by waiting palms. Shreyas Iyer had already stationed himself behind the crease, close to the stumps – that isn’t the ideal back-foot play of say someone like Michael Slater who would actively go back and across, creating his own length and time to play balls. Here Iyer had nowhere to go, and he hung his bat out. India were shot out for 36 in Adelaide a couple of years ago but that was drastically different. There, barring Kohli, no one chased a ball away from their body. Not one. Their hands didn’t betray them. Neither did their minds; not one threw away his wicket. They were brutally brushed aside by two craftsmen Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood at the peak of their powers, with a little bit of something beyond the mortals on the green. And it was a Pink ball. But this was different. For a long while in the day, South Africa had just one bowler in Rabada, then Burger stepped up, before Ngidi went berserk at the delightful turn of events. Luckily, for India though, South African batsmen were woeful in the morning, and their game didn’t really change much in the evening either as they lost three wickets for not much on the board. Much depended on the man playing his last Test innings, the man who had told his father on the eve of his remarkable match-winning knock in 2022 against the Indians: “If they want to get me out, they would have to break something in my body to drag me out of there, dad. They are not going to get me by hitting me on the body. No way in hell.” He did seem determined to hang on in the paradise on Wednesday evening, but couldn’t hold himself from poking an angler from Mukesh Kumar to Kohli at slips. Most Indians, including Kohli, ran to congratulate him and they would also have sighed in relief. The question now swirling in the air is: how much is too much for India to chase down?",Business,india vs south africa cape town test lessons wicket day bat test whats best thing happen india day lose wickets zero run south africa bat worse first innings shoot yield run lead dramatic days play could prove difference end south africa continue woeful ways second lose three wickets trail run pessimists would identify rundifference indias total pink ball test australia tour surely india cant implode day however perfect rant fall standards test bat first pakistans shenanigans flat track predawn australia tailender rescue follow south africas implosion afternoon india seal spontaneously combust even unintentional dark humour soon inningss turn point kl rahul get possess mysterious force swipe lungi ngidi short ball make first ball th virat kohli get involve game shepherd incoming batsman ravindra jadeja mutter string instructions jadeja last ball stab ngidi bouncer gully kohli go long way usher jasprit bumrah constantly chat newcomer bumrah also last ball undo kicker burst bat splice kohli turn attention mohammad siraj four ball speak three teammates one say alone middle lack company kohli conversations kagiso rabada pack fifth time test lifter back length induce hard push edge slip wickets fell like nine pin co target morning snap southafrica wickets first session test watch fall wickets tunein savind nd testlive star sport networkcricket pictwittercomviuogxcl star sport january rahuls decision ngidi relatively ordinary day shaun pollock sigh lack match practice everything would change cape town minute south africa india fan gameturning triple strike one tell statistic tell story two bat units despite numerous shout drs review lbw dismissal wickets fell speak bounce pitch main devil really also show techniques wither away perhaps cricket intelligence well number tell batsmen could leave ball length easy improbable make seem impossible relentless plonk front foot without second plan irony unceasing surprise extra bounce keep ram bat splice two team one batsman tony de zorzi first innings show ball leave length anything slightly short good length fly modernday cricket take away many nuances many leave lengths many compact backfoot play result shouldnt surprise anyone day justin langerlike leave lengths would withdraw bat watch ball sail middle stump doggedness steve waugh indias current coach rahul dravid show skill gumption stand toe nullify bounce take body blow along way werent short ball necessarily cut even pull unless one ricky ponting need dare skill gumption ability adapt wasnt part ticket fare grind shadow mountain two indian batsmen save day rohit sharma kohli rohit primarily bowl point bar rabada erratic sense mind purpose cash best innings belong kohli days blend aggression without boil intensity could relatively relax smile elgar mimic run south african field chat umpire would cuss couple time score opportunities lose realise importance pitch sequence shots th innings rabada capture essence knock pounce slightly short ball unfurl glorious onelegged pull shoot doesnt play often usually swatpulls bottomhanded wrist take conventional pull unfurl couple ball later cream gorgeous cover drive right trademark kohli gif soon stride forward immaculate defense bring dravid mind soon change though run partnership overs end rahuls impulsive decision counterattack anaesthetise ball run perhaps pull four previous rabada embolden maybe younger indians serve harsh crash course physics bounce ball yashasvi jaiswal defend rise ball indian pitch would fall near toe ball hit bat harder roll back fall stump shubman gill whose weight transfer issue test cricket try press back couldnt time stick internetloss buffer video ball ram bat splice swallow wait palm shreyas iyer already station behind crease close stump isnt ideal backfoot play say someone like michael slater would actively go back across create length time play ball iyer nowhere go hang bat india shoot adelaide couple years ago drastically different bar kohli one chase ball away body one hand didnt betray neither mind one throw away wicket brutally brush aside two craftsmen pat cummins josh hazlewood peak power little bite something beyond mortals green pink ball different long day south africa one bowler rabada burger step ngidi go berserk delightful turn events luckily india though south african batsmen woeful morning game didnt really change much even either lose three wickets much board much depend man play last test innings man tell father eve remarkable matchwinning knock indians want get would break something body drag dad go get hit body way hell seem determine hang paradise wednesday even couldnt hold poke angler mukesh kumar kohli slip indians include kohli run congratulate would also sigh relief question swirl air much much india chase,0
155,Sports maharajas and their fiefs,"There’s a true story about a Delhi cricket administrator’s single-minded obsession with holding on to power. It is hard to believe for those who haven’t spent enough time in Feroz Shah Kotla’s dark and dingy corridors of intrigue. It so happened that on the eve of a crucial local election, the wife of the incumbent eyeing to retain his influential position at the DDCA complained of stomach ache and had to be admitted to a hospital. Citing an emergency, the doctors planned a minor surgery for the next morning. Mr administrator was in a fix. Those present at the hospital that night recall a sickening conversation between the restless cricket administrator keen to be at Kotla on voting day and the outraged doctor. “He was informed that the operation would need general anaesthesia and his wife would regain consciousness after two hours,” recalls an old Delhi cricket veteran. “His reply blew us away. Without batting an eyelid, he asked the doctor, ‘Any chance you can administer anaesthesia for four hours as that would allow me that much more time at the Kotla as our panel needs to be re-elected?’” By late evening, he was part of the victory celebration at Kotla. Around him were men with garlands around their necks, a bunch drunk on power. Visceral battle cries would hit the Kotla air. While an outsider is sure to get outraged by the mixed-up priorities of the DDCA administrator, in the brotherhood of Indian cricket administrators, an example had been set. At Kotla, they still speak about the supreme sacrifice of one who chose cricket over family. To understand this absurd pull that can drag someone from a spouse’s hospital bed to the stadium, one needs to understand the dog-eat-dog world of administrators where playing the cards correctly could lead to a life of unquestionable power and endless perks. That’s why virtually every sporting body in the country — starting with the BCCI — fights tooth and nail against any clause that restricts the tenure of officials. Recently, former president of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh’s dream of being de facto chief hit a hurdle. After his tenure expired earlier last year, Brij Bhushan’s aide, Sanjay Singh, was elected WFI president. But within days of the selection, the new body was suspended. Brij Bhushan “appears to be in complete control”, was the sports ministry’s reasoning. The life of a seasoned sports administrator, with a serious disregard for rules, can be divided into three phases. It starts with the struggle to get into a federation that is a closed club. This is followed by the tough climb to the hot seat. Winning back-to-back elections, the kind the DDCA official managed when his wife went under the knife, is a sure sign of consolidation of power and the forming of a coterie. That’s the career-high for most administrators, but a handful manage to take that extra step. The true legends, mind you it’s not a virtue, manage to keep controlling a sports body without being part of it. To rule by proxy, one needs to be a seasoned politician. You need to be Brij Bhushan, a five-time BJP MP. He fits the bill to be a ringmaster without being in the ring. The other day at the Indian Olympic Association headquarters, at the end of the wrestling federation elections, Brij Bhushan’s supporters thought that he had swung it. Once it was clear that the odds-on favourite Sanjay Singh had been elected president, the members raised both their hands and let out triumphant shouts. They looked like MLAs outside an Assembly after a show-of-strength head count. In their glee at crossing the last high hurdle of administrative immortality, nuance went out of the window. Now they were openly announcing to the world that their “netaji” — facing sexual harassment charges by top women wrestlers — was back. They had seen it coming. Within minutes, several tackily-designed colour posters with “Dabdaba hai, dabdaba rahega” (our authority will remain) printed on them magically appeared on the scene. Like at Kotla that day, Brij Bhushan was drowned in garlands and surrounded by men drunk on power. However, there was an anti-climax. The government intervened and Sanjay Singh’s panel, with Brij Bhushan’s blessings, lasted barely three days. So does it mean this is well and truly the end of Indian wrestling’s Netaji Era? Unlikely. See the voting pattern of the WFI election to get the answers. The lone wrestler in the fray, Commonwealth Games gold medallist Anita Sheoran, lost by a margin of 40-7 to Brij Bhushan’s man Sanjay Singh. The detailed FIRs, the statement to the magistrate by those alleging sexual harassment by Netaji, didn’t move the 40 members who voted for Brij Bhushan. The members were part of the closed cosy club with Brij Bhushan being the Big Boss. Change could wait, right now Netaji needed them and they obliged. Had there been a change at the top and Anita had become WFI chief, the edifice of Brij Bhushan’s empire would have come tumbling down. It would have been great optics. But how could this all-men’s club allow a woman chief? But what is it about sports bodies that makes a five-time MP like Brij Bhushan cling to his chair? The power to decide the future of the country’s elite wrestlers, to be in the frame with national heroes at their time of glory, the authority to use funds and the lure to have a fiefdom of one’s own are the few obvious benefits that come with the turf. Brij Bhushan’s reign at WFI was a throwback to a time of kings. Sitting on the stadium dias like a maharaja, he would announce special gifts to winners and even snub referees. It was a power trip. So when Brij Bhushan was announcing the tournament schedule and showing V signs to the cameras within hours of his man winning the election, it was obvious that he wasn’t going to walk away from his home — his MP residence and the WFI had the same address. In a year when Olympic medallist Sakshi Malik was dragged through the streets of the capital and ended up hanging up her boots in disgust, 40 voting units chose to trust a politician with sexual harassment charges. For all its traditional facade of values, Indian wrestling remains an insensitive body run by compassionless sports officials — the kind for whom their “dabdaba” is more important than the ailing wife in the operation theatre or long-suffering women wrestlers. sandeep.dwivedi@expressindia.com",Business,sport maharajas fiefs theres true story delhi cricket administrators singleminded obsession hold power hard believe havent spend enough time feroz shah kotlas dark dingy corridors intrigue happen eve crucial local election wife incumbent eye retain influential position ddca complain stomach ache admit hospital cite emergency doctor plan minor surgery next morning mr administrator fix present hospital night recall sicken conversation restless cricket administrator keen kotla vote day outrage doctor inform operation would need general anaesthesia wife would regain consciousness two hours recall old delhi cricket veteran reply blow us away without bat eyelid ask doctor chance administer anaesthesia four hours would allow much time kotla panel need reelect late even part victory celebration kotla around men garland around neck bunch drink power visceral battle cry would hit kotla air outsider sure get outrage mixedup priorities ddca administrator brotherhood indian cricket administrators example set kotla still speak supreme sacrifice one choose cricket family understand absurd pull drag someone spouses hospital bed stadium one need understand dogeatdog world administrators play card correctly could lead life unquestionable power endless perk thats virtually every sport body country start bcci fight tooth nail clause restrict tenure officials recently former president wrestle federation india wfi brij bhushan sharan singhs dream de facto chief hit hurdle tenure expire earlier last year brij bhushans aide sanjay singh elect wfi president within days selection new body suspend brij bhushan appear complete control sport ministrys reason life season sport administrator serious disregard rule divide three phase start struggle get federation close club follow tough climb hot seat win backtoback elections kind ddca official manage wife go knife sure sign consolidation power form coterie thats careerhigh administrators handful manage take extra step true legends mind virtue manage keep control sport body without part rule proxy one need season politician need brij bhushan fivetime bjp mp fit bill ringmaster without ring day indian olympic association headquarter end wrestle federation elections brij bhushans supporters think swing clear oddson favourite sanjay singh elect president members raise hand let triumphant shout look like mlas outside assembly showofstrength head count glee cross last high hurdle administrative immortality nuance go window openly announce world netaji face sexual harassment charge top women wrestlers back see come within minutes several tackilydesigned colour posters dabdaba hai dabdaba rahega authority remain print magically appear scene like kotla day brij bhushan drown garland surround men drink power however anticlimax government intervene sanjay singhs panel brij bhushans bless last barely three days mean well truly end indian wrestle netaji era unlikely see vote pattern wfi election get answer lone wrestler fray commonwealth game gold medallist anita sheoran lose margin brij bhushans man sanjay singh detail firs statement magistrate allege sexual harassment netaji didnt move members vote brij bhushan members part close cosy club brij bhushan big boss change could wait right netaji need oblige change top anita become wfi chief edifice brij bhushans empire would come tumble would great optics could allmens club allow woman chief sport body make fivetime mp like brij bhushan cling chair power decide future countrys elite wrestlers frame national heroes time glory authority use fund lure fiefdom ones obvious benefit come turf brij bhushans reign wfi throwback time kings sit stadium dias like maharaja would announce special gift winners even snub referee power trip brij bhushan announce tournament schedule show v sign cameras within hours man win election obvious wasnt go walk away home mp residence wfi address year olympic medallist sakshi malik drag streets capital end hang boot disgust vote units choose trust politician sexual harassment charge traditional facade value indian wrestle remain insensitive body run compassionless sport officials kind dabdaba important ail wife operation theatre longsuffering women wrestlers sandeepdwivedicom,0
156,India’s way forward: Services or manufacturing?,"India is awash with discussions about where it is headed economically and how it might achieve its desired development goals. Some of this discussion is unfortunately a distraction. One example of this is the spectacle of myriad commentators tying themselves in Gordian knots while projecting India’s march towards a $5 trillion economy by 2025. Leaving aside the incredulousness of some of the assumptions underlying the projections, this exercise itself is a distraction because it focuses on aggregate GDP. The development challenge is to make the average citizen better off. Hence, the relevant target should be GDP per person, not total GDP. A recent book by Raghuram Rajan and Rohit Lamba, Breaking the Mould: Reimagining India’s Economic Future, has tried to frame the debate in more relevant terms. The book asks whether India can grow and develop by prioritising service sector growth rather than industrial growth. The backdrop to the question is that the currently developed economies had gradually switched their economic resources from agriculture to manufacturing to services as they developed. This pattern of structural transformation has also characterised the more recently industrialising Asian economies like China, Korea and Taiwan. India has had difficulties in expanding the share of the manufacturing sector in its economy. Instead, it has witnessed a somewhat different development path wherein most of the growth has happened in the service sector. Manufacturing’s share of both output and employment in India has plateaued at or below 20 per cent. In other words, India appears to be jumping a stage in the development process by going from a primarily agrarian to a mainly service economy. Is this sustainable in the long run? Growth of the service sector typically occurs through rising demands for medical, legal, entertainment, accounting and other personal services. Growth in these demands is the result of rising personal incomes of residents as well increasing outsourcing of business processes by firms as they grow. Rapid industrial growth creates ideal conditions for growth in domestic demand for both of these components. Since industrial growth in India has been tepid at best, where will the demand for the service sector come from? Messrs Rajan and Lamba spy an opening for India in the world business service growth that has been facilitated by the increasing sophistication of information technology. Firms globally are outsourcing parts of their business service requirements. This is becoming an increasingly important part of the global supply chain. The book provides examples of service business back offices that India is becoming a part of. The challenge of course is to do this at scale. The problem facing India though may be difficult to solve using a service-led model alone. India is adding around 8-10 million new workers to its labour force every year. This pace will continue for at least a decade. Moreover, a majority of these new workers are arriving in the labour market armed with high school or better educational attainment levels. Hence, their aspirations are commensurately high and further buoyed by the general national narrative of India finally arriving at the international stage of accomplishment. India is currently failing to meet the aspirations of young Indian workers. Monthly statistics from CMIE show that while the overall unemployment rate itself is very high at over 8 per cent, the unemployment rate for youth in the age-group 15-24 is above 40 per cent! Dealing with this looming employment crisis requires expedited measures to incentivise job creation at scale by private employers. It is in this context that one needs to evaluate both the service sector-led development model versus the more conventional manufacturing-led model. The current service sector in India is very segmented. Its output growth is primarily in high-tech services, while its job creation is mostly in low value-added, low skill services. Thus, the current service sector job creation does not generate income streams that the young aspire to. The back-office led service sector vision stressed by Rajan and Lamba, may be able to generate a substantial number of jobs in due course. However, it will still take 10-15 years for it to become a viable alternative. The problem is India’s skill deficit. India currently produces about 2.2 million STEM graduates, post-graduates and PhDs. Unfortunately, a majority of them are unemployable with the training that they receive. It will require sustained investment in the quality of higher education to create a cohort of adequately skilled workers who can be profitably employed in these higher human capital sectors. What happens in the interim though? One might be able to find some employment opportunities by expanding innovative health and education outreach programmes like Anganwadi workers. But there are limits to these. Plus, it is also unclear whether these programmes meet the aspirations of a majority of the young. One interpretation of the government’s PLI scheme is that it is an attempt to meet the political economy challenge of generating jobs now. If domestic and international businesses do indeed set up production centres in India that create jobs, then some of the jobs deficit may be corrected. The concern with the scheme is that it is production linked, not employment linked. Current component assembly-based production models in decentralised global supply chains do not necessarily create many jobs. Additionally, there are concerns about whether these businesses will stay or leave after the incentive schemes end. India’s jobs problem is real. With a median population age of 28, the problem will only get worse over time unless things change quickly. The country needs to combine the manufacturing and service sector models. It needs to go beyond the PLI schemes by incentivising private industry to scale up. Key for this are land and labour regulatory reforms. The good news is that these are fiscally costless though they do entail political costs. At the same time, India needs to address its skill deficit by raising its investment in higher education. India’s demographic dividend will become a demographic curse if the country fails to create relatively high value-added jobs at scale. It needs to act quickly and comprehensively.

157,"Who was Hamas leader Saleh al-Arouri, killed in a drone strike in Beirut?","One of Hamas’s most senior officials, Saleh al-Arouri, was killed in an Israeli drone strike in Beirut, Lebanon, on Tuesday (January 2). The drone hit a Hamas office, located in Beirut’s southern suburbs of Dahiyeh, a Hezbollah stronghold, and left six people dead. The Israeli government is yet to publicly claim responsibility for the attack but one Israeli and two US officials confirmed to Axios that Israel was behind the strike. Here is a look at who al-Arouri was and what does his killing mean for the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. Al-Arouri, 57, was from a village near Ramallah and joined Hamas in 1987. He helped establish the group’s military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades and remained deeply involved in its operations. Al-Arouri also founded the West Bank headquarters of Hamas. He spent 15 years in Israeli prison after which he was deported to Jordan in 2010. In recent years, al-Arouri resided in Beirut, where he acted as a Hamas ambassador to Hezbollah — a Lebanese Islamic militant organisation backed by Iran. He was one of the best-connected Hamas leaders to both Iran and Hezbollah. In 2014, Israel accused al-Arouri of planning the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers, which led to a 51-day war in Gaza. The same year, Israel also accused him of plotting to overthrow Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Three years later, Saleh al-Arouri was elected as deputy chairman of Hamas’s political bureau. Observers saw the development as a sign of the growing influence of Iran over Hamas. According to The New York Times, days after his election, Saleh al-Arouri went to Tehran and met the head of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah. In 2015, the US designated Saleh al-Arouri a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist” and has for years offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture. Saleh al-Arouri was one of the top-ranking officials of Hamas and his death comes as a major blow to the group. However, Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh on Tuesday said like the previous assassinations of its members, the organisation’s operation won’t be influenced. Analysts believe that the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah would escalate as Saleh al-Arouri was killed in the heart of Lebanon, which hosts the militant group. Soon after the incident, Hezbollah vowed to not let the assassination go without “retaliation or punishment”. Israel has already begun to prepare for the retaliation. Israeli officials told Axios that Hezbollah might launch long-range precision-guided missiles including on major cities like Haifa and Tel Aviv. “Such an attack could lead to a much stronger reaction by Israel that could quickly deteriorate into a regional war,” the Axios report added.",Business,hamas leader saleh alarouri kill drone strike beirut one hamass senior officials saleh alarouri kill israeli drone strike beirut lebanon tuesday january drone hit hamas office locate beiruts southern suburbs dahiyeh hezbollah stronghold leave six people dead israeli government yet publicly claim responsibility attack one israeli two us officials confirm axios israel behind strike look alarouri kill mean ongoing israelhamas conflict alarouri village near ramallah join hamas help establish group military wing izzedine alqassam brigade remain deeply involve operations alarouri also found west bank headquarter hamas spend years israeli prison deport jordan recent years alarouri reside beirut act hamas ambassador hezbollah lebanese islamic militant organisation back iran one bestconnected hamas leaders iran hezbollah israel accuse alarouri plan kidnap murder three israeli teenagers lead day war gaza year israel also accuse plot overthrow mahmoud abbas president palestinian authority govern part israelioccupied west bank three years later saleh alarouri elect deputy chairman hamass political bureau observers saw development sign grow influence iran hamas accord new york time days election saleh alarouri go tehran meet head hezbollah hassan nasrallah us designate saleh alarouri specially designate global terrorist years offer million reward information lead capture saleh alarouri one topranking officials hamas death come major blow group however hamas political leader ismail haniyeh tuesday say like previous assassinations members organisations operation wont influence analysts believe fight israel hezbollah would escalate saleh alarouri kill heart lebanon host militant group soon incident hezbollah vow let assassination go without retaliation punishment israel already begin prepare retaliation israeli officials tell axios hezbollah might launch longrange precisionguided missiles include major cities like haifa tel aviv attack could lead much stronger reaction israel could quickly deteriorate regional war axios report add,0
