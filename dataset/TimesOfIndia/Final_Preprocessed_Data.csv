How to spot a fake diamond?,"Diamonds are a womanâs best friend. However, in the world of precious stones, there are several alternatives to construct a diamond. All of them are not good or bad, but the problem starts when you get the stone that is not what itâs claimed to be. A fake diamond can also be white zircon, quartz, glass, white topaz, and even white spinel. Therefore, one should know how to spot a fake diamond and keep it close to your heart. Letâs check out some of how you can spot a fake diamond. Water testThis is one of the easiest tests, where you would just require a normal glass and need to fill three-quarters of it with water. The type of water used does not matter. Next, put a loose diamond inside the glass. If itâll sink then your diamond is pure. However, if you own a glass or quartz, it will float underneath or will just stay at the water's surface. Fog testThe fog test is another easy experiment that one can do. It is safe, easy, and applicable to both diamond jewelry and a loose diamond. Just take a diamond between two fingers, and blow some air on it. On the surface of a real diamond, the fog will disappear immediately. A fake stone on the other hand will keep the vape for several seconds, as due to its high conductivity ability, a real diamond will quickly disperse the heat.Best outfits to wear for Sunday brunchSparkle testOne can also observe the sparkling ability of the stone with a practical aim, as one needs to pay close attention to the way your gem reflects the light. It is common for a diamond to demonstrate gray and white sparkling from inside and then scatter in rainbow colors around.

If you look through the pointed side of a real diamond, you shouldn't see anything. However, if you look through the pointed side of a real diamond, you wonât be able to see anything. But if your ring is fake, then you will be able to see the dot crystal clear with no doubt.

Back pain on the rise in children: Whatâs the right way to wear a backpack?,"With children returning to school after the vacation, there is a possibility of a notable increase in back pain cases caused by improper backpack usage. In the article below, we will outline the proper method for wearing a backpack to prevent back pain. Many people associate back pain with adults, but it is also prevalent among children. âBack pain is not only associated with a child's spinal problems but even poor posture that is carrying heavy backpacks, improper sitting positions in class or at home, and frequently looking down at a phone or tablet.âChildren in Classes 1 and 2 should use weights between 1.5 kg and 2 kg, while children in Classes 3 to 5 should use weights between 2 kg and 3 kg. For children in Classes 6 to 8, the recommended weight range is between 3 kg and 4 kg, and for children in Classes 9 and 10, the suggested weight is 5 kg, however being said that the lesser the weight on the back the more chances of them having normal growth,â said Dr Pramod Bhor, Director of Orthopedics and Robotic Joint Replacement Surgeon, Fortis Hospital, Vashi.COVID variant JN.1 has minimum symptomsUnderstanding the appropriate weight for a backpack is a good beginning, but selecting the correct backpack is equally crucial. âThe bag should have dual straps, and children should wear it comfortably with both straps to evenly distribute the weight on each shoulder. The backpack should not hang below the waist region. Wearing a heavy backpack on one side won't lead to a curved spine or scoliosis in children, but it will create strain on that side. It's important to avoid overloading one side of the body, as this can cause muscle fatigue and discomfort when using that side,â said Dr Nitish Arora, Consultant Trauma, Limb Reconstruction, Deformity Correction & Pediatric Orthopedic Surgeon, Medicover Hospitals, Navi Mumbai.âParents should ensure that their child wears their backpack correctly, using both straps to evenly distribute the weight. When they are at home, promote good posture while sitting at a desk or using a phone or tablet. Parents can consult with their child's doctor about providing vitamin D and calcium supplements, particularly during the winter when there is less sun exposure or if their child participates in indoor sports. If they experience back pain due to their backpack or sitting position at school, making lifestyle adjustments and encouraging physical activity can effectively address the pain and prevent its recurrence,â concluded Dr Bhor.",Entertainment,"Back pain on the rise in children: Whatâs the right way to wear a backpack?

"BSE Sensex from 60,000 to 70,000: How PSU stocks took the lead over Reliance, Adani Group & Tata in wealth creation","State-owned companies have played a significant role in the BSE Sensex reaching the milestone of 70,000 points. The market capitalization of listed government assets almost doubled to around Rs 46.4 lakh crore for the final 10,000 points addition to Sensex. This surge in value has outperformed even leading private companies like Tata Group, Reliance, and the Adani Group.According to an ET analysis, during the 551 trading sessions it took for the Sensex to reach this milestone, the share of state-owned companies in India's total market capitalisation increased to approximately 13%. This reflects investor confidence in the government's reforms-driven agenda for state companies in sectors such as banking, insurance, infrastructure, and manufacturing. Value purchasing has also contributed to this positive trend.In contrast, the market value of the Tata Group increased from Rs 22.48 lakh crore to Rs 27.41 lakh crore since September 24, 2021, when the index stood at 60,000 points. Reliance Industries saw its market value rise from Rs 16.87 lakh crore to Rs 18.61 lakh crore. The Adani Group's market capitalisation also rose from Rs 9.78 lakh crore to Rs 14.37 lakh crore.PSU stocks on the top!According to Manish Chowdhury, head of research at StoxBox, the proactive and positive government initiatives have restored investor confidence in PSU stocks. Additionally, a sharper focus on operational efficiencies, improved execution capabilities, and a distinct move toward professional management have instilled a sense of assurance among market participants, he said.Public sector companies have collectively added nearly Rs 26.25 lakh crore in market capitalisation, including Rs 5.4 lakh crore contributed by newly listed companies like LIC and IREDA. Among the state-owned companies, 21 have witnessed a surge in their market value by three times or more since September 24, 2021, while another 19 have at least doubled in value.Pradeep Gupta, vice-chairman at Anand Rathi Group, highlighted that the search for relative value in a rapidly rising market seems to be one of the important reasons for the strong performance of PSU stocks in the recent past.

PE deals in healthcare surge in 2023 to $4.6 bn,"Buoyed by a burgeoning middle class, the healthcare sector continued to be a hub of private equity (PE) deal activity in 2023, with India registering 22 deals valued at $4.6 billion. This is a tad lower than the value of $4.7 bn in 2022. The countryâs growing middle class is catalyzing a significant surge in healthcare expenditure, propelled by the upswing in disposable incomes and a proliferation of insurtech platforms, alongside the presence of private payers, says Bain & Companyâs annual Global Healthcare Private Equity and M&A report. India has seen a long-term rise in biopharma-related activity (for example, in generics and active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing), albeit with a slowdown year over year, while also seeing growth in domestic demand driven by an expanding middle class and government insurance programs. These macroeconomic dynamics, coupled with a number of successful exits from early investors in Indiaâsuch as TPGâs sale of a controlling stake in Care Hospitals to Blackstoneâhave propelled private equity sponsors to regard India as a place to deploy healthcare capital at scale, it adds. Globally too, the sector held its own in a tepid market with deals totalling around $444 billion, despite higher global interest rates, inflationary pressures, and broader geopolitical uncertainty. Biopharma captured the bulk of dealmaking momentum, attributing 48% of global deal value, including six deals over $2 billion. In 2024, investors will continue to bet on the transformative nature of generative AI; new modalities and innovative therapies, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP-1s); and India as a place to deploy healthcare capital at scale, the report says. Investors seeking to manage geopolitical risk began to broaden their horizons, with India representing the largest share of announced deal value and continuing to see a long-term rise in biopharma-related activity. The domestic pharmaceutical sector, buoyed by government policies and skilled talent, holds a top-three global position in small molecule and generic manufacturing, satisfying 50% of global vaccine needs.Private equity investors, including Advent International, Carlyle, and PAG, capitalized on this growth, expanding in pharma services like CDMOs and APIs. The emergence of biologics as impending generics points to a potential shift, although China's dominance in generics, leveraging expertise in microbiology, remains a competitive edge.India has historically served as the back end for many US- and Europe-focused healthcare data and analytics companies; however, recent years witnessed a surge in direct-to-consumer digital health companies especially in fitness, wellness, telemedicine, and insurtech. Investments in and strategies focused on Asia-Pacific are evolving, and Indiaâs favorable macro tailwinds have made it a leading destination for capital. India has traditionally seen investments in biopharma and providers, and it is still too soon to know whether green shoots in other areas such as health insurance technology firms achieve comparable prominence, and whether these firms can parlay their success in India to expand across Asia-Pacific, the report said.",Business,"PE deals in healthcare surge in 2023 to $4.6 bn Buoyed by a burgeoning middle class, the healthcare sector continued to be a hub of private equity (PE) deal activity in 2023, with India registering 22 deals valued at $4.6 billion.

SoftBank veteran is a billionaire after another huge payday,"Nikesh Arora has repeatedly succeeded in winning big paychecks.At Google, he became the firmâs highest-paid executive after getting a compensation package worth about $51 million in 2012, on his way to collecting stock awards worth at least $200 million by the time he left.Poached in 2014 by SoftBank Group Corp.âs Masayoshi Son â and touted as the legendary investorâs likely successor â he amassed a $135 million first-year compensation package that broke Japanese records and made him the worldâs best-paid executive.But itâs Aroraâs latest stint, as chief executive officer of cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks Inc., thatâs catapulted the 55-year-old into the billionaire class.Palo Alto Networks handed Arora a $125 million stock and options compensation package when he was hired in 2018. Thanks to a boom in cybersecurity software after a series of high-profile hacking incidents that disrupted casinos, ports and even Treasury markets, the companyâs share price has more than quadrupled since then â and Aroraâs stake is now worth $830 million.Combined with enormous pay awards he secured earlier in his career, Aroraâs net worth stands at $1.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Aroraâs 2023 compensation includes a maximum of 750,000 stock awards that vest upon the achievement of certain performance conditions, which would currently be worth more than $220 million.In its proxy statement, the company wrote the award was justified because Aroraâs strong performance over his first five years meant heâd already been able to vest â$102 million of value each year.ââBecause of this significant vested ownership and the amount that Mr. Arora was projected to vest in over the next several years, the Board determined that a meaningful equity award would be necessary to ensure that such award retains and engages Mr. Arora.â",Business,"SoftBank veteran is a billionaire after another huge payday Nikesh Arora has repeatedly succeeded in winning big paychecks.At Google, he became the firmâs highest-paid executive after getting a compensation package worth about $51 million in 2012, on his way to collecting stock awards worth at least $200 million by the time he left.Poached in 2014 by SoftBank Group Corp.âs Masayoshi Son â and touted as the legendary investorâs likely successor â he amassed a $135 million first-year compensation package that broke Japanese records and made him the worldâs best-paid executive.But itâs Aroraâs latest stint, as chief executive officer of cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks Inc., thatâs catapulted the 55-year-old into the billionaire class.Palo Alto Networks handed Arora a $125 million stock and options compensation package when he was hired in 2018.

"Adani-Hindenburg row: Supreme Court upholds Sebi's probe, dismisses need for further investigation","In a significant development, the Supreme Court of India has reinforced the Securities and Exchange Board of India's (Sebi) ongoing investigation into the Adani-Hindenburg controversy. The apex court dismissed the need for further probes, emphasizing the adequacy of Sebi's efforts in addressing allegations of accounting fraud and stock manipulation by US short seller Hindenburg Research against the Adani Group.What's driving the newsThe Supreme Court's decision comes amid heightened scrutiny following Hindenburg Research's allegations against the Adani Group, involving fraudulent transactions and share-price manipulation.Petitioners seeking additional investigations cited a report by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and various newspaper articles, which the court found insufficient to undermine Sebi's comprehensive investigation.The big pictureThe apex court, led by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, underscored the importance of relying on investigations by specialized regulators over third-party reports or media articles. The court's stance reinforces the credibility of Sebi's investigation, dismissing the petitioners' reliance on external reports as unsubstantiated.What they are sayingThe SC bench said: ""The facts of this case do not warrant a transfer of investigation from Sebi. In an appropriate case, this court does have the power to transfer an investigation being carried out by the authorized agency to an SIT or CBI"".The Supreme Court said the Sebi's status report and the details of the 24 investigations do not indicate inaction by the market regulator.

"Wipro, ex-Wipro CFO Dalal referred to arbitration","BENGALURU: The Bengaluru Civil Court has referred both the parties-- former Wipro CFO Jatin Dalal and Wipro -- to arbitration. Judge Doddegowda K presided over the court proceedings on Wednesday.Dalal can invoke his rights to an arbitral tribunal following an order passed by the Bengaluru Civil Court on Wednesday. Dalal has filed an application asking the court to refer the matter to arbitration.He says his contracts with Wipro allow for arbitration. His reply notice also states that Wipro is not entitled to damages on the mere apprehension of confidential information being divulged.Arbitration is the use of an arbitrator, instead of a judicial court, to resolve a dispute.The Arbitration and Conciliation Act mandates that an award has to be passed within one year from the date of constitution of the arbitral tribunal. But the Act provides for the parties to agree to extend the period of the proceedings by six months and thereafter approach the court for extension by showing sufficient cause.TOI reported last week that Wipro has demanded Dalal to pay Rs 25 crore to the company for breach of contract, according to a suit filed in the civil court in Bengaluru. TOI has obtained a copy of the court papers. The company has also asked the court to restrain Dalal from disclosing confidential information, and soliciting its customers, vendors and employees, and has said it reserves the right to claim additional damages at a later date.Dalal left Wipro on November 30, and joined Cognizant as CFO the very next day.Wipro's Rs 25 crore claim is based on the value of RSUs (restricted stock units) and PSUs (performance share units) granted to Dalal since he took on the CFO role in 2015. The company says in the court filing that every one of the grants came with the condition that for a period of 12 months after his last date of employment, Dalal could not directly or indirectly engage with a competitor, could not solicit a Wipro customer to move the existing business to another party, and could not solicit a Wipro employee to be associated with a competitor, supplier or customer. The RSU and PSU agreements, it says, had also listed out 10 of Wipro's competitors, and the list included Cognizant. Wipro's court filing also says Dalal gave an undertaking to Cognizant - which is publicly available as a filing on the US SEC - which said, ""...I am not bound by the terms of any agreement with any previous employer or other party to refrain from competing directly or indirectly, with the business of such previous employer or other party, in any case, that would be violated by my entering into this agreement and/or providing services to Cognizant pursuant to the terms hereof.....""Wipro says this undertaking is ""patently false"" as Dalal continues to be bound by his obligations under the agreements with Wipro. ""As a result, the defendant has caused Cognizant to submit materially false and misleading statements in its SEC filing. The defendant's actions and conduct shows blatant disregard to his contractual and fiduciary obligation,"" Wipro says. The filing says Dalal has signed a 12-month non-compete and non-solicitation agreement with Cognizant in the event he were to quit the company, and says itâs ""unconscionable"" for Dalal to assert that he does not have a similar obligation to Wipro.",Business,"Wipro, ex-Wipro CFO Dalal referred to arbitration BENGALURU: The Bengaluru Civil Court has referred both the parties-- former Wipro CFO Jatin Dalal and Wipro -- to arbitration.

TOI has obtained a copy of the court papers. The company has also asked the court to restrain Dalal from disclosing confidential information, and soliciting its customers, vendors and employees, and has said it reserves the right to claim additional damages at a later date.Dalal left Wipro on November 30, and joined Cognizant as CFO the very next day.Wipro's Rs 25 crore claim is based on the value of RSUs (restricted stock units) and PSUs (performance share units) granted to Dalal since he took on the CFO role in 2015. The company says in the court filing that every one of the grants came with the condition that for a period of 12 months after his last date of employment, Dalal could not directly or indirectly engage with a competitor, could not solicit a Wipro customer to move the existing business to another party, and could not solicit a Wipro employee to be associated with a competitor, supplier or customer. The RSU and PSU agreements, it says, had also listed out 10 of Wipro's competitors, and the list included Cognizant. Wipro's court filing also says Dalal gave an undertaking to Cognizant - which is publicly available as a filing on the US SEC - which said, ""...I am not bound by the terms of any agreement with any previous employer or other party to refrain from competing directly or indirectly, with the business of such previous employer or other party, in any case, that would be violated by my entering into this agreement and/or providing services to Cognizant pursuant to the terms hereof.....""Wipro says this undertaking is ""patently false"" as Dalal continues to be bound by his obligations under the agreements with Wipro. ""As a result, the defendant has caused Cognizant to submit materially false and misleading statements in its SEC filing. The defendant's actions and conduct shows blatant disregard to his contractual and fiduciary obligation,"" Wipro says. The filing says Dalal has signed a 12-month non-compete and non-solicitation agreement with Cognizant in the event he were to quit the company, and says itâs ""unconscionable"" for Dalal to assert that he does not have a similar obligation to Wipro.",3373,"['wipro', 'cfo', 'dalal', 'referred', 'arbitration', 'bengaluru', 'bengaluru', 'civil', 'court', 'referred', 'party', 'former', 'wipro', 'cfo', 'jatin', 'dalal', 'wipro', 'arbitration', 'judge', 'doddegowda', 'k', 'presided', 'court', 'proceeding', 'invoke', 'right', 'arbitral', 'tribunal', 'following', 'order', 'passed', 'bengaluru', 'civil', 'court', 'wednesday', 'dalal', 'filed', 'application', 'asking', 'court', 'refer', 'matter', 'say', 'contract', 'wipro', 'allow', 'arbitration', 'reply', 'notice', 'also', 'state', 'wipro', 'entitled', 'damage', 'mere', 'apprehension', 'confidential', 'information', 'use', 'arbitrator', 'instead', 'judicial', 'court', 'resolve', 'arbitration', 'conciliation', 'act', 'mandate', 'award', 'passed', 'within', 'one', 'year', 'date', 'constitution', 'arbitral', 'tribunal', 'act', 'provides', 'party', 'agree', 'extend', 'period', 'proceeding', 'six', 'month', 'thereafter', 'approach', 'court', 'extension', 'showing', 'sufficient', 'reported', 'last', 'week', 'wipro', 'demanded', 'dalal', 'pay', 'r', 'crore', 'company', 'breach', 'contract', 'according', 'suit', 'filed', 'civil', 'court', 'bengaluru', 'toi', 'obtained', 'copy', 'court', 'paper', 'company', 'also', 'asked', 'court', 'restrain', 'dalal', 'disclosing', 'confidential', 'information', 'soliciting', 'customer', 'vendor', 'employee', 'said', 'reserve', 'right', 'claim', 'additional', 'damage', 'later', 'left', 'wipro', 'november', 'joined', 'cognizant', 'cfo', 'next', 'r', 'crore', 'claim', 'based', 'value', 'rsus', 'restricted', 'stock', 'unit', 'psus', 'performance', 'share', 'unit', 'granted', 'dalal', 'since', 'took', 'cfo', 'role', 'company', 'say', 'court', 'filing', 'every', 'one', 'grant', 'came', 'condition', 'period', 'month', 'last', 'date', 'employment', 'dalal', 'could', 'directly', 'indirectly', 'engage', 'competitor', 'could', 'solicit', 'wipro', 'customer', 'move', 'existing', 'business', 'another', 'party', 'could', 'solicit', 'wipro', 'employee', 'associated', 'competitor', 'supplier', 'customer', 'rsu', 'psu', 'agreement', 'say', 'also', 'listed', 'wipro', 'competitor', 'list', 'included', 'cognizant', 'wipro', 'court', 'filing', 'also', 'say', 'dalal', 'gave', 'undertaking', 'cognizant', 'publicly', 'available', 'filing', 'u', 'sec', 'said', 'bound', 'term', 'agreement', 'previous', 'employer', 'party', 'refrain', 'competing', 'directly', 'indirectly', 'business', 'previous', 'employer', 'party', 'case', 'would', 'violated', 'entering', 'agreement', 'providing', 'service', 'cognizant', 'pursuant', 'term', 'hereof', 'wipro', 'say', 'undertaking', 'patently', 'false', 'dalal', 'continues', 'bound', 'obligation', 'agreement', 'wipro', 'result', 'defendant', 'caused', 'cognizant', 'submit', 'materially', 'false', 'misleading', 'statement', 'sec', 'filing', 'defendant', 'action', 'conduct', 'show', 'blatant', 'disregard', 'contractual', 'fiduciary', 'obligation', 'wipro', 'say', 'filing', 'say', 'dalal', 'signed', 'agreement', 'cognizant', 'event', 'quit', 'company', 'say', 'unconscionable', 'dalal', 'assert', 'similar', 'obligation', 'wipro']"
French oyster sales clam up as contamination scare spreads,"RENNES: When Philippe Le Gal brought his oysters to market this weekend, he expected them to sell quickly. It was, after all, New Year's Eve, a day when the delicacies are a crucial ingredient for champagne-soaked celebrations in French homes and restaurants.But not this time. ""We barely sold 10 percent, almost nothing,"" the oyster farmer told AFP.The reason consumers are shunning French oysters is a health scare that hit the industry last week, when local authorities in the Gironde region observed a wave of gastroenteritis cases due to food poisoning. An investigation identified as the culprit the norovirus, a highly contagious virus causing vomiting and diarrhoea, detected in oysters from the Arcachon Bay west of Bordeaux on France's southwestern Atlantic coast.The authorities quickly banned the harvesting and sale of oysters from the area, and from two other oyster production sites further north, Calvados and Manche, ""until further notice"".They also told producers there to stop selling the oysters already harvested, and consumers to return them urgently.The contamination was a result of flooding in waste water treatment plants due to high rain water levels, which pushed untreated waste water into the ocean where it contaminated the oysters.'Crisis without precedent'The authorities promised they would lift the ban ""as soon as the sanitary quality of the shellfish is completely satisfactory again"".But the local shellfish producer association warned that ""an economic crisis without precedent"" was descending on the sector fast.""People are panicking,"" said Le Gal, who is also president of the National Shellfish Farming Federation.""They have stopped buying,"" he said. ""It's a catastrophe.""Le Gal said less than 10 percent of France's overall oyster production is affected by contamination, representing around 8,000 tonnes per year.But the impact has rippled across the entire industry.Philippe Morandeau, who runs the regional shellfish producers association in the western region of Charente-Maritime, said he too suffered a collapse in sales although his region has not been affected by any contamination.""I was on a market in La Pallice, near La Rochelle, and my sales were down by 25 to 30 percent compared with previous years,"" he told AFP.Producers point out that the contaminations are not their fault, but down to insufficient waste water treatment capacity which is the responsibility of local authorities. ""The biggest factor is indeed investment by local authorities in waste water treatment,"" acknowledged the French government's junior minister for maritime affairs, Herve Berville.""The temporary bans are not linked to the work of shellfish farmers. They are linked to viruses, not the quality of the oysters,"" he told regional daily Ouest France at the weekend.'Not just a glitch'Oyster farmers feel they are victims of what they say are decades of under-investment in water water facilities.""This has happened to us twice in two years. This is not just a glitch,"" said Olivier Laban, an oyster farmer who also runs the regional shellfish producer association in Arcachon, the main target area for the ban. ""This can't go on,"" he told AFP. Berville promised that the government would sit down with local authorities ""to accelerate investments where necessary"".

Atos says Airbus offers 1.5-1.8 billion euros for BDS unit,"French IT company Atos said on Wednesday Airbus had made an indicative offer of 1.5 billion to 1.8 billion euros ($1.64 billion-$1.97 billion) for Atos' big data & security (BDS) unit, briefly sending its shares up more than 10%. Atos said it would open due diligence talks with the world's biggest planemaker regarding the sale, one of a series of negotiations the company is involved in aimed at helping it reduce debt. Atos has faced a series of setbacks that have pummelled its shares for more than a year. An Airbus spokesperson confirmed in an e-mailed statement sent to Reuters, echoing an earlier report, that it had submitted a non-binding proposal. ""The acquisition of BDS could significantly accelerate the digital transformation of Airbus, enhance the company's defence and security portfolio with strong capabilities in cyber, advanced computing and artificial intelligence,"" Airbus said. Atos said it had also received a second offer for part of the unit, but did not name the potential buyer. Separately, Atos Chief Financial Officer Paul Saleh said exclusive negotiations with Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky's EPEI on the sale of its Tech Foundations unit are taking ""more time than planned"", with no certainty of an agreement being reached. ""Discussions continue around the price to be paid, the structure of the transaction and the transfer of a very large proportion of Tech Foundations liabilities,"" the company said in a press release. Initially Tech Foundations was to be sold to EPEI for 2 billion euros, with EPEI getting a 7.5% stake in Eviden for 180 million euros in the framework of a 900-million-euro capital increase. Atos said it now plans to reduce the capital increase, resulting in Kretinsky not taking a stake in Eviden at all. Atos added that it is in discussions with banks to maintain financing and obtain refinancing. It said in the first quarter of 2024 it will assess whether these measures are sufficient to cover financing maturities and cash requirements on a long-term basis.

Maersk to decide on Red Sea route as Hapag-Lloyd extends diversions,"OSLO: Denmark's Maersk said it will decide on Tuesday whether to resume sending vessels through the Suez Canal via the Red Sea or follow rival Hapag-Lloyd in continuing to re-route them after a weekend attack on one of its ships. The container shipping giant on Sunday paused all Red Sea sailings for 48 hours following attempts by Yemen-based Houthi militants to board the Maersk Hangzhou.U.S. military helicopters repelled the assault and killed 10 of the attackers. Maersk had more than 30 container vessels set to sail through Suez via the Red Sea, an advisory on Monday showed, while 17 other voyages were put on hold. A decision will be taken on Tuesday regarding how to proceed, a company spokesperson said. Hapag-Lloyd said on Tuesday its vessels would continue to divert away from the Red Sea - sailing via southern Africa's Cape of Good Hope instead - until at least Jan. 9. The company will decide then whether or not to continue re-routing its ships, a spokesperson said. Oil prices rose in the first session of the new year, boosted by potential disruption to Middle Eastern supply after the latest Red Sea attack. Shares in shipping companies have risen since the crisis began on expectations that longer routes will result in higher freight rates. Unlisted French shipping group CMA CGM increased its container shipping rates from Asia to the Mediterranean region by up to 100% as of Jan. 15 compared to Jan. 1, it said on its website on Tuesday. Shares in Maersk were up 6.3% in late afternoon trading. Hapag-Lloyd shares were up 4.1%. The Hangzhou, which was hit by an unknown object during the attack, was able to continue on its way with LSEG shipping data showing the vessel close to the Suez Canal. The Iranian-backed Houthis, who control parts of Yemen after years of war, started attacking international shipping in November in support for Palestinian Islamist group Hamas in its war with Israel in the Gaza Strip. Major shipping groups, including Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd, have stopped using Red Sea routes, instead taking the longer journey around the Cape of Good Hope. After the deployment of a U.S.-led military operation to protect ships, however, Maersk on Dec. 24 said it would resume using the Red Sea. According to Maersk, its alliance partner Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) was continuing to divert its vessels via the Cape of Good Hope. MSC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Suez Canal is used by roughly one third of global container ship cargo.

2nd Test: India regain advantage on unreal 23-wicket opening day battle at Newlands,"NEW DELHI: It was a wild ride for the batters on the opening day of the Cape Town Test as India clawed their way back to advantage on a venomous Newlands track that saw history books rewritten after a jaw-dropping 23 wickets fell on Wednesday.For the first time in over 100 years -- 25 wickets fell on the opening day of Australia vs England Test in Melbourne in 1902 -- batters paraded in and out as pacers made merry on a surface that offered load of seam movement and variable bounce.Mohammed Siraj first got six wickets in a breathtakingly menacing morning spell and it was followed by an unreal batting collapse from India -- losing six wickets for no run in a space of eleven balls in the final session -- as South Africa ended the the day at 62 for three in their second innings, trailing by another 36 runs.After Siraj's career-best 6/15 decimated South Africa for their lowest post-apartheid score of 55, India were 153 for 4 before losing six wickets without the addition of a single run to end with a 98-run lead.As It HappenedThere were six Indian batters, who failed to open their accounts and one who remained not out also didn't trouble the scorer, making it a statistician's nightmare.Lungi Ngidi (3/30) and Kagiso Rabada (3/38) got five of those six wickets keeping the lead below 100 and gaining the necessary psychological advantage as 23 wickets fell on the opening day.South Africa were more cautious despite being aggressive as they scored 62 for three in their second innings at stumps to bring down the deficit to 36 runs. Aiden Markram (32 batting) looked solid in the middle.The maximum number of wickets lost on Day 1 of a Test is 25 and that happened in an Ashes Test back in 1902.Dean Elgar, in his last Test match, would like to forget that he got out twice in a day's play while Mukesh Kumar (2/0 and 2/25) was rewarded for consistently pitching the ball in right areas, getting enough away movement against southpaws.Any chance of the match going into the third day looks remote.On a Newlands track that offered steep bounce and would certainly come under the ICC match referee Chris Broad's radar, the red Kookaburra ball took off like jumbo jet from the length making it impossible for batters to survive.Between shoulder blades to lower abdomen, batters got hit everywhere as the bounce became variable towards the end of the day.Rohit Sharma (39 off 50 balls) lived dangerously but smacked seven delicious fours, knowing that surviving won't get him anywhere.

Aiden Markram (32 batting) looked solid in the middle.The maximum number of wickets lost on Day 1 of a Test is 25 and that happened in an Ashes Test back in 1902.Dean Elgar, in his last Test match, would like to forget that he got out twice in a day's play while Mukesh Kumar (2/0 and 2/25) was rewarded for consistently pitching the ball in right areas, getting enough away movement against southpaws.Any chance of the match going into the third day looks remote.On a Newlands track that offered steep bounce and would certainly come under the ICC match referee Chris Broad's radar, the red Kookaburra ball took off like jumbo jet from the length making it impossible for batters to survive.Between shoulder blades to lower abdomen, batters got hit everywhere as the bounce became variable towards the end of the day.Rohit Sharma (39 off 50 balls) lived dangerously but smacked seven delicious fours, knowing that surviving won't get him anywhere.

How sizzling Siraj ripped apart South Africa's batting line-up in second Test,"NEW DELHI: Seamer Mohammed Siraj delivered a career-defining performance, claiming an outstanding 6-15 as India capitalised on a lively wicket to dismantle South Africa's batting line-up.The visiting side successfully bowled out the hosts for a mere 55 runs, accomplishing the feat on the brink of lunch during the opening day of the second Test at Newlands in Cape Town on Wednesday.Siraj, who did it in a straight spell of nine overs, was ably supported by Jasprit Bumrah (2-25) and Mukesh Kumar (2-0) as Indian pacers wreaked havoc after South African skipper Dean Elgar opted to bat in his swansong Test.Here is how the Indian pacers ripped apart South African batting in the first session of the second and final Test:SA 5/1 in 3.2 overs: Siraj quickly zeroed in on the perfect line, executing a precise delivery that resulted in Aiden Markram's (2) dismissal, giving India its first breakthrough. Yashasvi Jaiswal showcased sharp fielding skills, securing the catch at third slip.SA 8/2 in 5.3 overs: Returning just one over later, Siraj continued his impressive spell by dismissing Proteas skipper Elgar (4). In a poignant moment, Elgar, playing in his final Test before retirement, ended up chopping the ball onto his stumps, succumbing to Siraj's relentless bowling prowess.SA 11/3 in 8.3 overs: Bumrah enthusiastically joined the triumphant display as he skillfully had debutant Tristan Stubbs (3) caught at short leg, adding another wicket to India's dominant performance.SA 15/4 in 9.2 overs: Tony de Zorzi (2), who became Siraj's third victim, experienced a challenging moment as he was caught by wicketkeeper KL Rahul in a strangle down the legside off Siraj's skillful delivery. SA 34/5 in 15.2 overs: David Bedingham (12) stood out as the one batsman displaying composure at the wicket, but his resilience was tested when he misjudged a Siraj delivery that unexpectedly leapt off the surface. Bedingham's knock came to an end after Jaiswal swiftly caught him, showcasing the unpredictability and difficulty of Siraj's bowling abilities.SA 34/6 in 15.5 overs: Marco Jansen found himself on the wrong end of Siraj's prowess as he edged a delivery, resulting in the seamer claiming his fifth scalp of the innings. This was Siraj's first five-wicket haul in South Africa and third overall.SA 45/7 in 17.5 overs: Top scorer Kyle Verreynne (15) became Siraj's sixth victim in his ninth over. The relentless display of skill and accuracy by Siraj left an indelible mark on the Proteas' batting lineup, showcasing his exceptional performance in the match.SA 46/8 in 19.6 overs: Seamer Mukesh, who came in for Shardul Thakur, celebrated his first wicket of the match as he dismissed Keshav Maharaj (3), marking a significant breakthrough for the bowler.(Reuters Photo)SA 55/9 in 22.6 overs: Nandre Burger found himself on the wrong side of a skillful delivery from Bumrah, resulting in a nick at third slip to Jaiswal, who held a sharp catch. The precision and control demonstrated by Bumrah in this delivery added another wicket to India's tally.SA 55/10 in 23.2 overs: Mukesh ended the South African innings by inducing Kagiso Rabada to edge a delivery to fourth slip.

Surprised that South African skipper Dean Elgar chose to bat first: Gavaskar,"NEW DELHI: Former captain Sunil Gavaskar expressed astonishment on Wednesday at South African skipper Dean Elgar's choice to bat first in the second Test against India in Cape Town.Elgar's decision did not go as planned, resulting in South Africa being dismissed for 55 runs, their lowest total against India.Although India initially seemed on track for a substantial lead, they encountered a collapse, losing their last six wickets for no runs and getting all out for 153, thereby limiting their first-innings advantage to 98 runs.Gavaskar's surprise likely stems from the unexpected turn of events in the match.""Well, I tell you what, I was a bit surprised by what happened,"" Gavaskar said in his match analysis on Star Sports.""Because a lot of times, captains and coaches make a big deal about what the pitch is gonna be...""Gavaskar expressed the opinion that, having dominated India and won the opening Test within three days, South Africa had a perfect opportunity to assert their dominance by inserting India on a fresh pitch in the second Test.Gavaskar's view likely reflects the strategic advantage South Africa could have gained by exploiting the conditions and putting India under pressure early in the match. However, the outcome of the match, with both teams facing challenges in their respective innings, may have added an element of unpredictability to the decision-making process.""I think you've also got to look at the psychology of the Indian team, having been defeated in three days, having batted so poorly in the second innings and going to be batting first on a fresh pitch would have been just a little bit defensive,” Gavaskar said.""And I have thought that South Africans with the fast bowlers that they have in their lineup could look to take advantage of the fact that they have not played any cricket in between and therefore put them in,” he added.Gavaskar drew a parallel to the Adelaide Test against Australia, where India was bowled out for 36, only to make a remarkable comeback in the subsequent Melbourne Test during the 2020-21 series.The Adelaide Test was a challenging moment for the Indian team, but they displayed resilience and character to bounce back and eventually secure a memorable 2-1 series triumph.""Something similar happened in Australia two years ago, Australia dismissed India for 36.

2022 winner Suryakumar Yadav again in running for ICC Men's T20 Cricketer of Year,"NEW DELHI: India's Suryakumar Yadav has been nominated for the ICC Men's T20 Cricketer of the Year 2023. The 33-year-old, who previously secured this accolade in 2022, continued to make a mark in the shortest format during 2023.Suryakumar amassed an impressive total of 733 runs from 17 innings, maintaining an average of 48.86 and a striking rate of 155.95.His consistent and impactful performances have earned him recognition as one of the standout T20 cricketers of the year.It's noteworthy that young Indian opening batter Yashasvi Jaiswal has been recognized as one of the four nominees for the ICC Men's Emerging Cricketer of the Year 2023.This nomination acknowledges Jaiswal's promising performances and potential as a rising star in the cricketing world. His inclusion among the nominees reflects his impact and contributions in the emerging cricketer category during the specified year.Jaiswal, the 22-year-old Indian opening batter, has put up an impressive performance in the year. He scored 283 Test runs with an average of 70.75. In T20 Internationals (T20Is), he made 430 runs at an average of 33.07 and an outstanding strike rate of 159.25 throughout the year.Jaiswal's notable contributions have earned him a nomination for the ICC Men's Emerging Cricketer of the Year 2023.He faces competition in this category from other talented emerging players, including Rachin Ravindra from New Zealand, Gerald Coetzee from South Africa, and Dilshan Madushanka from Sri Lanka. The nomination recognizes Jaiswal's growth and impact in international cricket as a young and promising talent.Despite a modest start with just 7 runs in his first innings of 2023 against Sri Lanka, Suryakumar swiftly rebounded, showcasing his prolific form throughout the year. In the subsequent two matches, he delivered outstanding performances, scoring 51 runs off 36 balls in one match and an impressive unbeaten 112 off 51 balls in the next.During his remarkable innings of 112, Suryakumar displayed his wide array of shots, featuring inside-out drives and skillful play behind the wicket.Notably, this innings included nine sixes and seven fours, illustrating his ability to score boundaries consistently, averaging almost one boundary every three deliveries. Such displays underscore Suryakumar's versatility and impact as a dynamic T20 batsman.His first boundary came off just the fourth ball of his innings, and it took just 45 balls to reach three figures. The effort was the second-fastest hundred for India in men's T20s behind Rohit Sharma's 35-ball effort against the same opponent in 2017, and India were clear 91-run winners.Consistent scoring in 20s to 40s continued, before an innings of 83 (44 balls) against the West Indies in Providence proved his class. He ended the series against the West Indies with a knock of 61 (45 balls) in Florida.Suryakumar flourished despite the burden of captaincy, taking the reins of a young Indian side towards the end of the year.He made half-centuries against Australia (80 off 42 balls) and South Africa (56 from 36 balls), before posting an even 100 against the Proteas off just 56 balls in their final T20 of the year in Johannesburg.The other three nominees are Sikandar Raza of Zimbabwe (11 innings, 515 runs at 51.50, strike rate 150.14; 17 wickets at 14.88, economy 6.57), Alpesh Ramjani of Uganda (55 wickets at 8.98, economy 4.77) and Mark Chapman of New Zealand (17 innings, 556 runs at 50.54, strike rate 145.54).(With PTI inputs)Explore Your Financial Landscape with Personalized Credit Insights.",Sports,"2022 winner Suryakumar Yadav again in running for ICC Men's T20 Cricketer of Year NEW DELHI: India's Suryakumar Yadav has been nominated for the ICC Men's T20 Cricketer of the Year 2023.

"'Having overrated cricketers...': Kris Srikkanth feels after Virat Kohli's Test captaincy era, team has underperformed","NEW DELHI: Former Indian opener Kris Srikkanth lambasted the Indian Test team, labelling them an overrated side in the longest format as they have performed below-par in the recent past while deserving candidates have been cooling their heels in the dressing room.India fell to an innings defeat in Centurion in the first Test and are playing their second and final Test of the South Africa series in Cape Town starting Wednesday, hoping to win it so they can eke out a draw against their opponents.The former Indian captain remarked that India showcased strength in Test cricket during the 2-4 years of Virat Kohli's captaincy. However, he went on to suggest that the team has been relying solely on the reputation of past achievements since then.""Test cricket, we are overrated. I think it was a phase of 2-3 years where we were outstanding when Virat Kohli was the captain of the team. We dominated in England, we fought hard in South Africa, we won in Australia,"" Srikkanth said on his YouTube channel.Srikkanth also emphasized the need for India to overlook the ICC rankings, asserting that numerous players in the Indian team are overrated. He argued that quality players are currently sidelined, sitting outside the Test team.""We have to forget the ICC rankings. We are always 1-2, 1-2. It's a combination of having overrated cricketers and people who have not performed up to their potential. Or there are players who do not have enough chances, like Kuldeep (Yadav),"" Srikkanth said.Sharing his views on one-day cricket and T20Is, Srikkanth feels Team India is a gun side in ODIs regardless of where they play. But in the shortest format, we are highly overrated.""In T20 cricket India are highly overrated. ODI cricket, we are a fantastic team. What happens in ODIs, in the semi-finals, finals, it's just a one-off match. It's a luck factor, a lot depends on luck in these matches. I read Rohit Sharma's statement, for a cricketer; the 50-over World Cup is a huge achievement. We are sometimes underperforming in the knockout matches, in the semifinals and the final. But we are a gun side in ODIs.

I read Rohit Sharma's statement, for a cricketer; the 50-over World Cup is a huge achievement. We are sometimes underperforming in the knockout matches, in the semifinals and the final. But we are a gun side in ODIs. Regardless of where we play, be it India, Australia or South Africa, we are a gun side,"" Srikkanth said.Explore Your Financial Landscape with Personalized Credit Insights.",2398,"['overrated', 'cricketer', 'kris', 'srikkanth', 'feel', 'virat', 'kohli', 'test', 'captaincy', 'era', 'team', 'underperformed', 'new', 'delhi', 'former', 'indian', 'opener', 'kris', 'srikkanth', 'lambasted', 'indian', 'test', 'team', 'labelling', 'overrated', 'side', 'longest', 'format', 'performed', 'recent', 'past', 'deserving', 'candidate', 'cooling', 'heel', 'dressing', 'fell', 'inning', 'defeat', 'centurion', 'first', 'test', 'playing', 'second', 'final', 'test', 'south', 'africa', 'series', 'cape', 'town', 'starting', 'wednesday', 'hoping', 'win', 'eke', 'draw', 'former', 'indian', 'captain', 'remarked', 'india', 'showcased', 'strength', 'test', 'cricket', 'year', 'virat', 'kohli', 'captaincy', 'however', 'went', 'suggest', 'team', 'relying', 'solely', 'reputation', 'past', 'achievement', 'since', 'test', 'cricket', 'overrated', 'think', 'phase', 'year', 'outstanding', 'virat', 'kohli', 'captain', 'team', 'dominated', 'england', 'fought', 'hard', 'south', 'africa', 'australia', 'srikkanth', 'said', 'youtube', 'also', 'emphasized', 'need', 'india', 'overlook', 'icc', 'ranking', 'asserting', 'numerous', 'player', 'indian', 'team', 'overrated', 'argued', 'quality', 'player', 'currently', 'sidelined', 'sitting', 'outside', 'test', 'team', 'forget', 'icc', 'ranking', 'always', 'combination', 'overrated', 'cricketer', 'people', 'performed', 'potential', 'player', 'enough', 'chance', 'like', 'kuldeep', 'yadav', 'srikkanth', 'view', 'cricket', 'srikkanth', 'feel', 'team', 'india', 'gun', 'side', 'odis', 'regardless', 'play', 'shortest', 'format', 'highly', 'overrated', 'cricket', 'india', 'highly', 'overrated', 'odi', 'cricket', 'fantastic', 'team', 'happens', 'odis', 'final', 'match', 'luck', 'factor', 'lot', 'depends', 'luck', 'match', 'read', 'rohit', 'sharma', 'statement', 'cricketer', 'world', 'cup', 'huge', 'achievement', 'sometimes', 'underperforming', 'knockout', 'match', 'semifinal', 'final', 'gun', 'side', 'odis', 'regardless', 'play', 'india', 'australia', 'south', 'africa', 'gun', 'side', 'srikkanth', 'financial', 'landscape', 'personalized', 'credit', 'insight']"
India vs South Africa 2nd Test: Rohit Sharma faces critical decisions as Team India aims to bounce back against South Africa,"NEW DELHI: As Team India looks to level the series against South Africa in the second Test starting on Wednesday, captain Rohit Sharma faces crucial decisions to rejuvenate the team's prospects. After a disappointing defeat at Centurion, Sharma needs to carefully choose his bowling options and address the batting vulnerabilities exposed by the South African pace attack.Key all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja is set to make a comeback, providing the much-needed balance to the middle-order batting and contributing with steady overs. However, Sharma's critical decision lies in selecting the third and fourth fast bowlers, with Prasidh Krishna and Shardul Thakur under scrutiny. While Prasidh lacks experience in Test cricket, Shardul's bits and pieces talent may not be sufficient on most days.The top-order batters, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill, and Shreyas Iyer, struggled against the bouncer barrage in the first Test, emphasizing the importance of batting depth. Shardul's inclusion provides an assumption of depth on paper, but Sharma must weigh the trade-offs.With one loss and one draw in three Tests in the new World Test Championship cycle, India are desperate for a win. However, the picturesque Newlands ground, where they have lost four of their previous six games, poses a significant challenge.Sharma, still reeling from India's World Cup final defeat and the recent Test loss, will seek redemption at Newlands. The skipper's tactical acumen will be under scrutiny, and his decisions on the playing XI could shape India's response.The toss is expected to be crucial at Newlands, where the pitch promises to be a batting paradise with little assistance for spinners. Jadeja's return is likely to see the exclusion of Ravichandran Ashwin.Sharma's most significant decision will be whether to stick with his specialist batters or introduce fresh faces like Mukesh Kumar and Avesh Khan. The two rookies, with limited Test experience, might provide a stronger challenge and inject some unpredictability into the bowling attack.As South Africa boast a formidable batting lineup, featuring Elgar, Markram, de Zorzi, Petersen, and Bedingham, the new ball overs will be vital for India. Bumrah's performance, coupled with favorable weather conditions, will be key to India's bowling strategy.While the bowlers need to step up, Sharma, the batter, also needs to rediscover his form.

2nd Test: India reach 111/4 at tea after dismissing South Africa for 55,"CAPE TOWN: A career-best six-wicket haul from Mohammed Siraj helped India dismiss South Africa for a lowly 55 before the visitors raced to 111 for 4 at tea on the opening day of the second Test here.India lead the Proteas by 56 runs despite losing the top order. The pitch isn't the easiest for batting and the match could end well inside three days if not two.In a straight spell of nine overs, Siraj picked six for 15 as the South African batters made a beeline back to the dug-out, unable to counter the disconcerting bounce and the movement, both inward and outward, that he extracted off the surface.It was also South Africa's lowest total in Test cricket since their readmission into international cricket in 1991.However the Indian batters also didn't fare any better against the awkward angle and steep bounce generated by the new Proteas left-arm speedster Nandre Burger (3/42).Rohit Sharma (39 off 50 balls) and Shubman Gill (36 off 55 balls) hit a dozen of boundaries between them but talented duo of Yashasvi Jaiswal (0) and Shreyas Iyer (0), from the famed “Khadoos School of Mumbai Cricket” didn't trouble the scorers, after once again being exposed for technical ineptitude.A Special SpellBefore Siraj's special effort, the only Indian in country's 92 year Test history to take five wickets before lunch was left-arm spinner Maninder Singh, who achieved the feat against Pakistan in Bengaluru back in 1986-1987.On a humid Wednesday morning, South African batters found what a great leveller the game of cricket is with Siraj ripping the heart out of the Proteas batting with a masterclass of pace, swing and seam movement. The Proteas innings ended in just 23.2 overs.David Bedingham (12) and Kyle Verreynne (15) were the only two batters to hit the double digits as the South African supporters in stands were stunned into silence.Jasprit Bumrah (2/25 in 8 overs) also kept the pressure from the other end as Indian skipper Rohit Sharma kept his promise of making opposite number Dean Elgar's life miserable in his farewell Test.Mukesh Kumar (2/0) also wrapped the tail up and proved that he is way better than a bits and pieces Shardul Thakur in these conditions.Having been pilloried for conceding 400 plus runs in the heavy defeat at the Centurion, even the biggest of Indian supporters wouldn't have envisaged such a roaring comeback from the bowlers.Siraj kept the ball on fuller lengths between 4-6 metres and with bounce got most balls to jag back in.From the other end, Bumrah hit the back of length area as Rohit set completely attacking fields, albeit of different nature.When Siraj bowled initially, there was a leg-slip placed while for Bumrah, Rohit himself stood at short leg.The procession started with Aiden Markram going on a ‘fishing expedition' to a delivery that moved in air and shaped away with the opener closing his bat face. Yashasvi Jaiswal took a fantastic catch at third slip to send back Markram.The stodgy Elgar played one to his stumps off Siraj who angled one across on fuller length, not giving him enough room to play the cut shot.Bumrah got young Tristan Stubbs into a tangle and the simple catch was gobbled up by skipper at short-leg.Tony De Zorzi's affinity to whip balls off the hips was exploited as he was caught down the leg-side.Unlike Centurion, there were plans in place and David Bedingham, who was fed on the backfoot in the first Test, was enticed to go for a drive on length and extra bounce did the trick.Once Marco Jansen edged Siraj to give him his fifth scalp, one knew that South Africa would have one of their most embarrassing mornings since return to international cricket.Explore Your Financial Landscape with Personalized Credit Insights.",Sports,"2nd Test: India reach 111/4 at tea after dismissing South Africa for 55 CAPE TOWN: A career-best six-wicket haul from Mohammed Siraj helped India dismiss South Africa for a lowly 55 before the visitors raced to 111 for 4 at tea on the opening day of the second Test here.India lead the Proteas by 56 runs despite losing the top order.

Watch: David Warner gets 'Guard of Honour' from Pakistan players in his farewell Test in Sydney,"NEW DELHI: Australian batter David Warner received a 'Guard of Honour' from Pakistan players as he stepped out to bat on the first day of the third and final Test match in Sydney. This special acknowledgment took place as Warner is playing his farewell Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground, his home turf.

2nd Test: Mohammed Siraj's career-best 6/15 helps India bowl South Africa out for 55 at lunch on Day 1,"NEW DELHI: A menacing Mohammed Siraj picked up career-best figures of 6 for 15 as South Africa skittled to 55 all out in the morning session on Day 1 of the Cape Town Test. The pacer wreaked havoc with the new ball as only a couple of Proteas batters managed double-digit scores amid a horrifying collapse.Pacers Jasprit Bumrah and Mukesh Kumar provided Siraj with perfect support, grabbing a couple of wickets each as South Africa folded inside 24 overs. Siraj conceded just 15 runs from his nine overs as he triggered an abject surrender from South African batters on a pace-bowling friendly pitch.At the time their captain Dean Elgar described the pitch as an ""interesting wicket with a few snakes in it"", but there was also some poor shot selection from the hosts.  India’s seamers have been able to get movement off the wicket, but there is also variable bounce at a venue where there has been some low scores.  New Zealand were bowled out for 45 in 2013 and Australia for 47 in 2011.  South Africa’s previous lowest innings total against India in tests was 79 at Nagpur in 2015. At home it was 130 at the same Newlands venue in 2018.  Siraj found the right line immediately and had Aiden Markram (2) caught by Yashasvi Jaiswal at third slip. Home captain Elgar (4), in his last test before retirement, chopped onto his stumps.  Jasprit Bumrah (2-25) had debutant Tristan Stubbs (3) caught at short leg, before South Africa were 15-4 when Tony de Zorzi (2) was caught by wicketkeeper KL Rahul with a strangle down the legside off Siraj.  David Bedingham (12) looked the one batter who was composed at the wicket before he misjudged a Siraj delivery that leapt off the surface and he was grabbed by Jaiswal.  Kyle Verreynne (15) and Marco Jansen (0) were also victims of the seamer's unerring line and length, before Keshav Maharaj (3) became a first wicket in the match for seamer Mukesh Kumar (2-0) as the visitors ran through the tail.

"Nato to help buy 1,000 Patriot missiles to defend allies as Russia ramps up air assault on Ukraine","BRUSSELS: Nato announced Wednesday that it would help buy up to 1,000 Patriot missiles so that allies can better protect their territory as Russia ramps up its air assault on Ukraine.Natoâs Support and Procurement Agency said it will support a group of nations, including Germany, the Netherlands, Romania and Spain, in buying the Patriots, which are used to defend against cruise and ballistic missiles as well as enemy aircraft.According to industry sources, the contract could be worth around $5.5 billion.The purchase could help allies free up more of their own defense systems for Ukraine. The agency said that âother user nations are expected to benefit from the conditions of the contract,â without elaborating.âRussian missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian civilians, cities and towns show how important modern air defenses are,â Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement. âScaling up ammunition production is key for Ukraineâs security and for ours.âAs an organization, Nato provides only non-lethal support to Ukraine, but its members send weapons and ammunition individually or in groups.Russia's latest round of attacks began Friday with its largest single assault on Ukraine of the conflict, which has bogged down into a grinding winter war of attrition along the 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line.

Israel ready 'for any scenario' after strike kills Hamas deputy in Lebanon,"Israel kept bombing Gaza on Wednesday after the army warned it is ready for ""any scenario"" following a drone strike in Lebanon which killed the deputy leader of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, stoking fears of a regional escalation.Although Israel did not claim the Beirut assassination on Tuesday evening, it was widely assumed to be behind the killing of Saleh al-Aruri, 57, the political number two of its enemy Hamas and one of the founders of the Islamist group's military wing. After Aruri and six other militants were killed in the attack, Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari said the military was in a ""very high state of readiness in all arenas"" and ""highly prepared for any scenario"".The Israeli armed forces again bombed Gaza targets overnight, including in the crowded southern city of Rafah where eyewitnesses said survivors flocked to Al-Najjar Hospital to mourn the dead, including a child.Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas after the militant group's bloody October 7 attack and has launched a relentless military campaign in Gaza that has claimed over 22,000 lives, according to the territory's health ministry.Israel has labelled Hamas's Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar a ""dead man walking"" and vowed to also kill other commanders of the Islamist movement considered a ""terrorist"" group by the United States and European Union.Amid the almost three-month-old war, Israel has traded almost daily cross-border fire with the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed ally of Hamas, while so far avoiding a full-scale war.Maha Yahya of think tank the Carnegie Middle East Center told that Aruri's killing was ""a significant escalation"" but added: ""I don't think Hezbollah will be willing to drag Lebanon into a major conflict at this particular moment and time given the situation regionally"".Violence has also flared with other militant groups in the Iran-led ""Axis of Resistance"", including in Syria, Iraq and Yemen, where Huthi rebels have attacked cargo vessels in the Red Sea, a key shipping lane for world trade.Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian condemned the ""cowardly"" Beirut strike and said it proved that Israel ""has not achieved any of its goals after weeks of war crimes, genocide and destruction in Gaza and the West Bank of Palestine, despite the direct support of the White House"".'Dangerous development'Hezbollah vowed Aruri's killing would not go unpunished and labelled it ""a serious assault on Lebanon... and a dangerous development"".The Shiite Muslim group's leader Hassan Nasrallah, who has lived in hiding for years, was due to deliver a televised address on Wednesday evening.Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati charged that the killing ""aims to draw Lebanon"" deeper into the war, while French President Emmanuel Macron urged Israel to ""avoid any escalatory attitude, particularly in Lebanon"".In the Israel-occupied West Bank -- the Palestinian territory where Aruri was born, and which has seen an upsurge in violence since October 7 -- the Palestinian Authority called a general strike to mourn his death.Palestinian prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh also condemned the killing and warned of its ""risks and consequences"".The Gaza war started after the Hamas attack on Israel killed around 1,140 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.Militants also took around 250 hostages back to Hamas-ruled Gaza, 129 of whom remain in captivity, according to Israeli figures.In response to deadliest attack in its history, Israel launched a relentless offensive on Gaza that has reduced vast swathes of the territory to rubble.Most of its 2.4 million people have been displaced and forced south, where many now live in crowded shelters and tents.UN agencies have warned of a spiralling humanitarian crisis. But the war has raged unabated despite efforts towards a new ceasefire like the week-long truce in late November that allowed the release of more than 100 hostages.'We both now have nothing'Another strike, on the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza on Tuesday, again saw Palestinians rush to rescue victims and retrieve bodies from the rubble.""There are about 12 martyrs so far, mostly children,"" said bereaved resident Ghazi Darwish.

UN experts sound alarm over planned first US execution by nitrogen gas,"GENEVA: United Nations experts on Wednesday called on US authorities not to go ahead with the planned execution of an inmate by nitrogen hypoxia, saying the method may subject him to ""cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or even torture"".Kenneth Smith, convicted for a murder-for-hire committed in 1988, is scheduled to be executed in the US state of Alabama on Jan 25 using the method, which is intended to deprive him of oxygen by using a face mask connected to a cylinder of nitrogen. Smith, 58, is one of only two people alive in the US to have survived an execution attempt after Alabama botched his previously scheduled execution by lethal injection in November 2022 when multiple attempts to insert an intravenous line into a vein failed. ""This will be the first attempt at nitrogen hypoxia execution,"" four UN Special Rapporteurs said in a statement, saying the method could cause ""grave suffering"" and likely be at odds with the prohibition on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment. ""We are concerned that nitrogen hypoxia would result in a painful and humiliating death."" Smith's lawyers have said the untested gassing protocol may violate the US Constitution's ban on ""cruel and unusual punishments"", and have argued a second attempt to execute him by any method is unconstitutional. Most US executions are carried out using lethal doses of a barbiturate, but some states have struggled to obtain the drugs because of a European Union law banning pharmaceutical companies from selling drugs that can be used in executions to prisons.Explore Your Financial Landscape with Personalized Credit Insights.",World,"UN experts sound alarm over planned first US execution by nitrogen gas GENEVA: United Nations experts on Wednesday called on US authorities not to go ahead with the planned execution of an inmate by nitrogen hypoxia, saying the method may subject him to ""cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or even torture"".Kenneth Smith, convicted for a murder-for-hire committed in 1988, is scheduled to be executed in the US state of Alabama on Jan 25 using the method, which is intended to deprive him of oxygen by using a face mask connected to a cylinder of nitrogen.

"Hong Kong prosecutors allege democracy publisher Jimmy Lai urged protests, sanctions against China","HONG KONG: Prosecutors on Wednesday alleged that Hong Kong activist and publisher Jimmy Lai had encouraged the city's residents to protest and urged the U.S. to take action against the ""oppressive"" Chinese authorities in Beijing. The 76-year-old media tycoon, who founded the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper, was arrested in 2020 during a crackdown on massive pro-democracy protests that rocked Hong Kong in 2019.The central government in Beijing responded by imposing a sweeping national security law aimed at stamping down opposition. Lai has been in jail for over three years. Lai's national security trial is being closely watched by foreign governments, business professionals and legal scholars. Many view it as a trial of the city's freedoms and a test for judicial independence in the Asian financial hub. Lai has pleaded not guilty to two charges of conspiring to collude with foreign countries and another count of conspiring to publish seditious material. He smiled at family members as he entered the court Wednesday and put his hands together to show appreciation to supporters in the public gallery. One supporter shouted ""Hang in there!"" and was hushed by guards. Prosecutor Anthony Chau on the fifth day of the trial presented what he said were Lai's instructions to senior management and editors at Apple Daily to come up with ways to urge the Hong Kong public to protest a proposed extradition bill in 2019.  The bill, which was later withdrawn following protests, could have allowed suspects to be extradited from Hong Kong to mainland China, where Communist Party-dominated courts are accused of handing down convictions based on political considerations and using coerced confessions. Prosecutors submitted 31 pieces of allegedly seditious content published on Apple Daily, including articles and commentaries as well as pages urging people to protest. Some of the material even advocated for violence in the protests, the prosecution argued. In his commentaries, Lai alleged that the Chinese Communist Party sought to control Hong Kong via ""electronic means and totalitarian machines,"" Chau said. Lai had allegedly also given instructions to Apple Daily to introduce English content for the purpose of asking foreign countries to engage in sanctions against China and Hong Kong, the prosecution said. WhatsApp messages purportedly showing that Lai had instructed editors to only concentrate on the ""yellow"" viewpoint - the color of the pro-democracy camp and the ""voice that the world wants to know"" - were also shown to the court. Garnering support from political leaders such as former U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as well as Sen. Marco Rubio via subscription to the English service would be a ""protection"" for Apple Daily, Lai had allegedly said in his messages. Hong Kong is a former British colony that returned to China's rule in 1997 under a promise the city would retain its Western-style civil liberties for 50 years. That promise has become increasingly threadbare since the introduction of the security law, which has led to the arrests and silencing of many leading pro-democracy activists. The governments of both Hong Kong and China have hailed the law for bringing back stability to the city. Hong Kong, once seen as a bastion of media freedom in Asia, ranked 140th out of 180 countries and territories in Reporters Without Borders' latest World Press Freedom Index. The group said the city had seen an ""unprecedented setback"" since 2020, when the security law was imposed.Explore Your Financial Landscape with Personalized Credit Insights.",World,"Hong Kong prosecutors allege democracy publisher Jimmy Lai urged protests, sanctions against China HONG KONG: Prosecutors on Wednesday alleged that Hong Kong activist and publisher Jimmy Lai had encouraged the city's residents to protest and urged the U.S. to take action against the ""oppressive"" Chinese authorities in Beijing.

US military launches secretive X-37B robot spaceplane on mysterious high-orbit mission,"In a significant development for US military space operations, the secretive X-37B robot spaceplane was launched from Florida on Thursday night. This marks its seventh mission and the first to be launched atop a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket, potentially reaching higher orbits than ever before.Driving the newsThe Falcon Heavy, the most powerful operational rocket in the world, lifted off from NASAâs Kennedy Space Center in Florida in a dazzling display of fire and smoke.The launch was delayed for more than two weeks due to bad weather and technical issues, but finally went ahead after a smooth countdown and liftoff.The X-37B, a reusable, uncrewed spacecraft that looks like a mini space shuttle, is operated by the US Space Force for classified missions that test new technologies and conduct experiments in orbit.The X-37B has flown six previous missions since 2010, each lasting longer than the previous one. The last mission, which ended in October 2021, set a record of 908 days in space.The X-37Bâs current mission, dubbed OTV-7, is the first to launch on a Falcon Heavy rocket, which has three times the thrust of the Falcon 9 rocket that carried the previous mission.The Falcon Heavy could enable the X-37B to reach a higher orbit than before, possibly as high as geosynchronous orbit, where satellites stay over the same point on Earth. The X-37B has previously flown in low-Earth orbit, at altitudes of up to 1,200 miles (2,000 km).The big pictureThe X-37B, a Boeing-built vehicle resembling a miniature space shuttle, has been a cornerstone of the US military's foray into reusable space technology.Its previous missions, primarily in low-Earth orbit, have been shrouded in secrecy, focusing on testing new technologies and conducting various experiments. The use of SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket for this mission highlights a crucial collaboration between the US military and private space industry, showcasing significant advancements in rocket technology and payload delivery.Why it mattersThe X-37B's latest mission underscores the growing strategic importance of space in national security and technological advancement. Its ability to reach higher orbits and potentially venture near the moon represents a significant leap in capabilities, reflecting the intensifying space race, particularly in the context of US-China rivalry. This mission could pave the way for new forms of space-based surveillance, communication, and other classified operations.What they are sayingThe Pentagon has remained tight-lipped about the specific objectives of the X-37B's latest mission, only stating that it will test ""new orbital regimes and future space domain awareness technologies.""""Maybe this thing's going go out toward the moon and drop off a payload,"" said Bob Hall, director of space traffic monitoring firm COMSPOC, who analyzes the trajectories of orbital objects. The closer the spacecraft flies to the moon, the more difficult it could be to safely return to Earth.There was no official word as to whether the X-37B made it to its intended initial orbit following launch.Industry analysts and space enthusiasts are speculating that the spacecraft might be headed for a highly elliptical orbit or even towards the moon, a region increasingly of interest to the Pentagon.The mission also includes a NASA experiment to study the effects of space radiation on plant seeds, indicating a broader scope of research that could benefit future long-duration space mission.What to watch out forAs the X-37B embarks on its latest journey, the mission's secrecy and potential for higher-orbit operations add a new dimension to space exploration and military capabilities. With the US and China both advancing their respective space technologies, the X-37B's mission could be a critical step in determining the future dynamics of space exploration and security. China's equally secretive Shenlong was carried to space on December 14 by a Long March 2F rocket, a launch system less powerful than SpaceX's Falcon Heavy and believed to be limited to delivering payloads to low-Earth orbit.Still, Space Force General B Chance Saltzman told reporters at an industry conference earlier this month he expected China to launch Shenlong around the same time as the X-37B flight in what he suggested was a competitive move.""These are two of the most watched objects on orbit while they're on orbit. It's probably no coincidence that they're trying to match us in timing and sequence of this,"" Saltzman said, according to remarks published in the journal Air & Space Forces Magazine.The duration and outcomes of this mission will be closely watched by governments and space agencies worldwide, eager to understand the evolving landscape of space operations and technology.(With inputs from agencies)Explore Your Financial Landscape with Personalized Credit Insights.",World,"US military launches secretive X-37B robot spaceplane on mysterious high-orbit mission In a significant development for US military space operations, the secretive X-37B robot spaceplane was launched from Florida on Thursday night.

"US sinks 3 ships, kills 10 after Houthi Red Sea attack","NEW DELHI: US helicopters successfully thwarted an attack by Iran-aligned Houthi rebels on a Maersk container ship in the Red Sea, resulting in the sinking of three rebel ships and the death of 10 militants, as confirmed by American, Maersk, and Houthi representatives on Sunday.The maritime clash took place at approximately 0330 GMT on Sunday when the Houthis attempted to board the Singapore-flagged Maersk Hangzhou.In response to a distress call, helicopters from the USS Eisenhower and USS Gravely, along with the vessel's security team, repulsed the attackers, as reported by Maersk and the US Central Command (CENTCOM).Following the incident, Maersk announced a 48-hour suspension of its Red Sea operations.Tension in Red Sea: Houthis claim US missile explode near Gabon-owned shipA Houthi spokesperson acknowledged their involvement in the attack, citing the ship's crew's disregard for their warnings. He reported that 10 Houthi naval members were either killed or missing following the US counteraction in the Red Sea.This naval engagement highlights the potential for regional conflict escalation, particularly in the context of Israel's ongoing airstrikes in response to a surprise attack by Hamas on Israeli towns on October 7, which resulted in 1,200 deaths and 240 hostages. The Israeli response has led to over 21,800 fatalities, as per Gazan health authorities.The Houthis have been targeting vessels in the Red Sea since November in solidarity with Hamas, compelling major shipping firms to opt for the lengthier and more expensive route around Cape of Good Hope instead of the Suez Canal. The Red Sea is a crucial entry point to the Suez Canal, which is vital for Asia-Europe trade, handling around 12% of global commerce.Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi militia claims responsibility for missile attack on container ship in Red SeaOn December 19, the United States initiated Operation Prosperity Guardian with participation from over 20 countries to ensure maritime security near Yemen in the Red Sea.Despite Maersk's decision to resume Red Sea operations on December 24, ongoing attacks and limited coalition support have persisted, with many allies hesitant to publicly declare their involvement.The recent failed boarding attempt on the Maersk Hangzhou marks the second such attack within two days. The vessel, transporting 14,000 containers from Singapore, had previously been struck by a missile near Al Hodeidah, Yemen. Maersk confirmed the crew's safety and reported no fire on board, with the ship proceeding towards the Suez Canal.In response to inquiries about potential US actions against the Houthis, White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby emphasized the seriousness with which the US views these threats, without detailing specific strategies.British Defence Secretary Grant Shapps, in a Daily Telegraph article, expressed the UK's readiness for direct action to safeguard Red Sea navigation, warning the Houthis against underestimating their resolve.British Foreign Secretary David Cameron urged Iran in a conversation with Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian to intervene in stopping Houthi attacks in the Red Sea.The BIMCO shipping association, condemning the attacks, expressed gratitude for the efforts of the US, France, and the UK, and called for broader state support and diplomatic pressure on the Houthis and their backers.

The Red Sea is a crucial entry point to the Suez Canal, which is vital for Asia-Europe trade, handling around 12% of global commerce.Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi militia claims responsibility for missile attack on container ship in Red SeaOn December 19, the United States initiated Operation Prosperity Guardian with participation from over 20 countries to ensure maritime security near Yemen in the Red Sea.Despite Maersk's decision to resume Red Sea operations on December 24, ongoing attacks and limited coalition support have persisted, with many allies hesitant to publicly declare their involvement.The recent failed boarding attempt on the Maersk Hangzhou marks the second such attack within two days. The vessel, transporting 14,000 containers from Singapore, had previously been struck by a missile near Al Hodeidah, Yemen. Maersk confirmed the crew's safety and reported no fire on board, with the ship proceeding towards the Suez Canal.In response to inquiries about potential US actions against the Houthis, White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby emphasized the seriousness with which the US views these threats, without detailing specific strategies.British Defence Secretary Grant Shapps, in a Daily Telegraph article, expressed the UK's readiness for direct action to safeguard Red Sea navigation, warning the Houthis against underestimating their resolve.British Foreign Secretary David Cameron urged Iran in a conversation with Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian to intervene in stopping Houthi attacks in the Red Sea.The BIMCO shipping association, condemning the attacks, expressed gratitude for the efforts of the US, France, and the UK, and called for broader state support and diplomatic pressure on the Houthis and their backers. Jakob Larsen, head of maritime safety and security at BIMCO, communicated this stance to Reuters.(With inputs from agencies)Explore Your Financial Landscape with Personalized Credit Insights.Watch US thwarts Houthi attack in Red Sea, destroys vessels, kills 10 militants",3714,"['u', 'sink', 'ship', 'kill', 'houthi', 'red', 'sea', 'attack', 'new', 'delhi', 'u', 'helicopter', 'successfully', 'thwarted', 'attack', 'houthi', 'rebel', 'maersk', 'container', 'ship', 'red', 'sea', 'resulting', 'sinking', 'three', 'rebel', 'ship', 'death', 'militant', 'confirmed', 'american', 'maersk', 'houthi', 'representative', 'maritime', 'clash', 'took', 'place', 'approximately', 'gmt', 'sunday', 'houthis', 'attempted', 'board', 'maersk', 'response', 'distress', 'call', 'helicopter', 'us', 'eisenhower', 'us', 'gravely', 'along', 'vessel', 'security', 'team', 'repulsed', 'attacker', 'reported', 'maersk', 'u', 'central', 'command', 'centcom', 'incident', 'maersk', 'announced', 'suspension', 'red', 'sea', 'red', 'sea', 'houthis', 'claim', 'u', 'missile', 'explode', 'near', 'shipa', 'houthi', 'spokesperson', 'acknowledged', 'involvement', 'attack', 'citing', 'ship', 'crew', 'disregard', 'warning', 'reported', 'houthi', 'naval', 'member', 'either', 'killed', 'missing', 'following', 'u', 'counteraction', 'red', 'naval', 'engagement', 'highlight', 'potential', 'regional', 'conflict', 'escalation', 'particularly', 'context', 'israel', 'ongoing', 'airstrikes', 'response', 'surprise', 'attack', 'hamas', 'israeli', 'town', 'october', 'resulted', 'death', 'hostage', 'israeli', 'response', 'led', 'fatality', 'per', 'gazan', 'health', 'houthis', 'targeting', 'vessel', 'red', 'sea', 'since', 'november', 'solidarity', 'hamas', 'compelling', 'major', 'shipping', 'firm', 'opt', 'lengthier', 'expensive', 'route', 'around', 'cape', 'good', 'hope', 'instead', 'suez', 'canal', 'red', 'sea', 'crucial', 'entry', 'point', 'suez', 'canal', 'vital', 'trade', 'handling', 'around', 'global', 'houthi', 'militia', 'claim', 'responsibility', 'missile', 'attack', 'container', 'ship', 'red', 'seaon', 'december', 'united', 'state', 'initiated', 'operation', 'prosperity', 'guardian', 'participation', 'country', 'ensure', 'maritime', 'security', 'near', 'yemen', 'red', 'maersk', 'decision', 'resume', 'red', 'sea', 'operation', 'december', 'ongoing', 'attack', 'limited', 'coalition', 'support', 'persisted', 'many', 'ally', 'hesitant', 'publicly', 'declare', 'recent', 'failed', 'boarding', 'attempt', 'maersk', 'hangzhou', 'mark', 'second', 'attack', 'within', 'two', 'day', 'vessel', 'transporting', 'container', 'singapore', 'previously', 'struck', 'missile', 'near', 'al', 'hodeidah', 'yemen', 'maersk', 'confirmed', 'crew', 'safety', 'reported', 'fire', 'board', 'ship', 'proceeding', 'towards', 'suez', 'response', 'inquiry', 'potential', 'u', 'action', 'houthis', 'white', 'house', 'national', 'security', 'spokesperson', 'john', 'kirby', 'emphasized', 'seriousness', 'u', 'view', 'threat', 'without', 'detailing', 'specific', 'defence', 'secretary', 'grant', 'shapps', 'daily', 'telegraph', 'article', 'expressed', 'uk', 'readiness', 'direct', 'action', 'safeguard', 'red', 'sea', 'navigation', 'warning', 'houthis', 'underestimating', 'foreign', 'secretary', 'david', 'cameron', 'urged', 'iran', 'conversation', 'iranian', 'foreign', 'minister', 'hossein', 'amirabdollahian', 'intervene', 'stopping', 'houthi', 'attack', 'red', 'bimco', 'shipping', 'association', 'condemning', 'attack', 'expressed', 'gratitude', 'effort', 'u', 'france', 'uk', 'called', 'broader', 'state', 'support', 'diplomatic', 'pressure', 'houthis', 'backer', 'jakob', 'larsen', 'head', 'maritime', 'safety', 'security', 'bimco', 'communicated', 'stance', 'reuters', 'input', 'agency', 'explore', 'financial', 'landscape', 'personalized', 'credit', 'u', 'thwart', 'houthi', 'attack', 'red', 'sea', 'destroys', 'vessel', 'kill', 'militant']"

Job cuts at Arm: Chip designer lays off over 70 engineers in China,"Arm Holdings, the company that designs CPU cores used in chips, has laid off over 70 software engineers working in China. The Britain-based company will, however, relocate some of the roles outside of the country, a report has claimed. Citing people with knowledge of the move, a report by Bloomberg claims that about 15 of the laid off staff will be offered different roles and will work on China-related projects. The decision comes soon after other major chip makers, including Qualcomm, have cut back on the global staffing level as they are hit by the demand-hit downturn in the semiconductor industry. “In order to ensure that the China Software Ecosystem can fully maximise the benefits of Arm performance and features, Arm is restructuring its China software engineering resources to focus on direct support for local developers,” the company said, without mentioning the number of jobs that have been eliminated. Contract workers filling the void  The report also said that the jobs that are now vacant are being filled by contract software engineers who have worked on projects that span Arm’s business around the world. Earlier this year, Arm’s Chinese entity let go of over 100 employees, most of them working in the research and development unit to create new chip technology for the local market, the people were cited as saying. Why tech companies are interested in Arm Arm’s technology is essential to nearly all mobile phones as major technology companies, including Apple, Samsung, Google and Qualcomm rely on Arm’s processor design to develop their own chips.  Apple’s A-series chips, Samsung’s Exynos, Google Tensor, and others are manufactured on Arms design. Amazon’s cloud unit, Amazon Web Services, makes its processing chip called Graviton using Arm's design. Earlier this year, reports suggested that several tech companies rushed to invest in the company ahead of its IPO. It raised $4.87 billion in an initial public offering.

"iPhone 15 series is 'costing' Apple more than its predecessor, here's how"," launched the latest iPhones, the iPhone 15 and   15 Pro series last month. The entire lineup includes four smartphones and iPhone 15 Pro Max is the most expensive amongst them. Starting at Rs 1,60,000, the smartphone comes with a Titanium frame and succeeds last year’s iPhone 14 Pro Max. The flagship smartphone may bring several upgrades than its predecessor but may have ‘bad news’ for the Cupertino-based tech giant. According to a recent teardown conducted by Nihon Keizai Shimbun and Fomalhaut Techno Solutions of Japan (spotted by AppleInsider), it was discovered that the production cost of the iPhone 15 Pro Max is nearly 12% higher than that of its predecessor. This analysis indicated that Apple spends around $558 on components for each unit of the iPhone 15 Pro Max. Among other crucial factors, Apple's profit margins on its products depend on controlling the cost of hardware. The company even aims to reduce costs, but the inclusion of new features can sometimes drive the overall cost upward. The report also noted that the iPhone 15 Pro Max has a 47% parts-to-cost ratio. Parts that increased the cost The iPhone 15 Pro Max’s display is 10% more expensive than its iPhone 14 predecessor. Moreover, the titanium frame also pushed the production costs by 43%, while the A17 Pro chip is 27% pricier than the A16 Bionic chip.  The telephoto camera, equipped with a tetraprism system, was also one of the significant contributors to the cost as it was, being 3.8 times more expensive than the one used in the iPhone 14 Pro Max, as reported. Other components within the iPhone 15 series are also more expensive than last year’s models.  Increase in the cost of other iPhone 15 models iPhone 15 Pro's production cost reaches $523, which marks an 8% increase from the previous year's model. Meanwhile, the iPhone 15 Plus incurs a cost of $442, which is roughly 10% higher than the iPhone 14 Plus. In the lineup, the iPhone 15 records the highest cost escalation, with its bill of materials amounting to $423. This was a 16% surge compared to the iPhone 14. In comparison, the iPhone 14 Pro Max was 3.7% costlier to produce than the iPhone 13 Pro Max.

How the government regulation led to over 80% fall in Cloudtail India's revenue,"Once among the largest sellers on   India online marketplace, Cloudtail India has reported an 84% year-on-year plunge in operating revenue in FY23 to Rs 2,977.8 crore. According to a report in Economic Times, quoting company intelligence platform Tofler, the fall comes as the company has stopped selling on Amazon to fall in line with the regulations, according to filings made with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. “During the financial year ended on March 31, 2023, the board of directors in its meeting held on March 17, 2022, approved the cessation of business-to-consumer (B2C) business of the company on or prior to April 23, 2022, which was followed by shareholders’ approval in its extraordinary general meeting held on March 19, 2022. Accordingly, the company ceased to carry its B2C business with effect from April 23, 2022,” the filing said. With the fall in revenues, Cloudtail’s net loss also contracted to Rs 97.8 crore in FY23 from Rs 521.8 crore a year earlier. The report further adds that the parent company of Cloudtail India has been renamed from Prione Business Services to Amazon Smart Commerce Solutions. In 2022, Amazon became a full owner of Prione after acquiring a 76% stake from Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy’s Catamaran Ventures. Why Amazon cut down its stake in Cloudtail Cloudtail India was set up in 2014 as a joint venture between Amazon and Catamaran Ventures. It happened to be one of the biggest sellers on Amazon India. However, Amazon was forced to trim its stake to 24% from 49% in 2019 to comply with the country’s foreign direct investment (FDI) regulations for the ecommerce sector. Subsequently, the company announced that Cloudtail would cease to be a seller on the marketplace as the latest norms did not allow an entity running an online marketplace and its group companies to own equity in any of the sellers on the platform or to have control over their inventory. Cloudtail India continues to provide certain services on the Amazon marketplace such as seller onboarding, and merchandising and cataloging of products on the platform.

This is how Apple’s new patent wants to ‘change’ Vision Pro’s external display," is expected to start shipping its first-ever mixed reality headset, the Vision Pro, in the coming weeks. Now, a new patent related to the AR/VR headset that was submitted by the company has been granted. The latest patent details how the company is planning to use the Vision Pro’s external display to show what the user is looking at inside the device. How Apple is planning to ‘change’ Vision Pro’s external display According to a report by Patently Apple, the latest patent that mentions Jony Ive as an inventor details ways how an outside screen on a generic head-mounted display could be used to indicate what the user is seeing for people around them.  However, it's important to note that the patent isn’t specifically about the Vision Pro and its “EyeSight” display feature. Yet, it suggests that some of the ideas here may be included in the final headset. For example, Apple has already discussed how the outer screen on the Vision Pro can let outsiders see the eyes of the person wearing the headset. The headset may also display a colourful pattern that indicates the user is fully immersed in VR.  The pictures shared in the patent details how an external display could be used for other usages, like displaying the weather, sunglasses on user’s face, a ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign, or even replacing the wearer’s eyes with Zoom icons. It is also important to note that Apple being granted a patent doesn’t necessarily mean that these ideas will show up in the Vision Pro or other Apple headsets. Moreover, replacing the user's eyes with Zoom icons can be inconvenient for users. For example, in situations when they’re at an important work meeting with their Vision Pro can become a problem for the users and the people around them.

Change this one Apple iPhone setting to stop apps from tracking you," announced App tracking features in June 2020 while unveiling iOS14. The same came to app apps in the second half of 2022. Apple said. In iOS 14, users will be asked if they want to be tracked by the app. Apple also said it will also require app developers to self-report the kinds of permissions that their apps request. This will improve transparency, allowing the user to know what kind of data they may have to give over in order to use the app. It also will explain how that collected data could be tracked outside of the app. In simple words, Apple's App Tracking Transparency feature offers Apple users a simple choice, to allow apps to track their activity or not. If you choose to opt-out, Apple will prevent the app from accessing identifiers that link your device with your activity on an app, usually shared with advertisers to create targeted ad How to turn off app tracking on new apps Here's how you can turn off app tracking in the news app that you download. Look for the app in the App Store. Once downloaded, open the new app, you'll get a pop-up notification that asks if you want to let the app track your activity across other companies' apps and websites. It will also show you the information about what the app would track. You can tap Ask App Not to Track to block that activity or Allow. You can also opt out of app tracking across every app you download by making this change default. Go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking and toggling off Allow Apps to Request to Track. This means any app that tries to ask for your permission will be automatically blocked from asking and told that you have requested not to be tracked. All apps (other than those that you have given permission to track in the past) will be blocked from accessing your phone's information used for advertising, according to Apple.  Please note that this does not mean that ads will disappear. It just means that you are more likely to see generic ads, and not about the perfume or any other product you searched for or clicked on.  How to turn off app tracking on apps that you have already downloaded You can also turn app tracking permissions On or Off on a per-app basis.  To do this, go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking. Here you will see the list of apps that have requested to track you. Tap the toggle next to the apps you want to stop tracking you. All app developers are required to ask for permission for tracking. If Apple learns a developer is tracking users who asked not to be tracked, they will need to either update their tracking practices or else potentially face rejection from the app store. Please remember that when you ask apps not to track you, what you're saying is that you do not want app developers to have access to your unique identifier that Apple created specifically for advertisers -- your IDFA. Denying access to your  's IDFA doesn't necessarily mean app developers won't track you through other means, so it is important to be mindful of the apps you use and how you interact with them. For those unaware, IDFA is a random device identifier assigned by Apple to a user’s device. Since the rollout of iOS 14.5 and App Tracking Transparency (ATT) advertisers are required to ask for user consent via a prompt to access the IDFA.

"Three ways Microsoft can challenge Google, Apple in mobile market","Last year,   CEO Satya Nadella said that one of his biggest 'mistakes' was the company exiting the smartphone business, adding that the company might have been able to do better. The company has now again set its sights at the mobile business but in a different way. Here are three ways Microsoft can challenge   and   – two of the leaders in the smartphone market. Microsoft's $69 billion Activision deal   Microsoft went to great lengths to get its deal with Activision Blizzard King finalised in multiple regions and markets. With the deal, Microsoft has two of the most loved games in the mobile ecosystem – Candy Crush Saga and Call of Duty.  The former is one of the company’s most valuable assets, and a big contributor to its $3.5 billion of 2022 mobile revenue. It brought $721 million in revenue and Call of Duty, which also provides an expansion opportunity in its Xbox division, brought $243 million in 2022. Partnering for mobile game store Microsoft’s deal with Activision has also provided the company enough engaging content to offer users. While the company is already preparing for cloud gaming, which currently is in a nascent stage – and also looking to give a tough competition to Apple and Google when it comes to app stores. The company has already talked about an alternative app store to Apple’s App Store and Google Play Store where users can find games and other content. This may also help in forcing Google and Apple to work on their alleged monopoly that they enjoy in the mobile ecosystem. AI investments Artificial intelligence gave Microsoft a head start in the industry to quickly capture the market which slowly and steadily launches its own AI-powered products. Recently, Microsoft rebranded Bing Chat – one its successful AI products – to Copilot and launched apps for both Android and iPhones. Google’s Bard still does not have a dedicated app yet.

"AI, Apple VisionPro and more: What to expect in 2024","2023 was all about artificial intelligence, chatbots and then some more AI. It is quite likely that 2024 could shape up on the same lines in tech town. Big tech companies have loaded their arsenal with AI tools and will unleash them in 2024. But it won’t be restricted to AI as smart glasses, headsets all will make a splash in the coming year.  Glass half full: See it with a tint of tech Granted, smart glasses aren’t really new but the refinements expected in 2024 could make them something to watch out for. A lot of brands have experimented with smart glasses. There’s Amazon Echo Frames that has the power of Alexa whereas Meta’s partnership with Ray-Ban has been going strong. The Ray-Bans have a 12MP camera which allows you capture images and record videos. You can make calls, listen to music and do more with just the glasses. Fitness rings: One ring to monitor it all Fitness rings are the next evolution of wearable tech, ditching the wristband and still have the ability to track your every step, jump, and shimmy. Features like personalised workout routines, sleep monitoring, and much more. Domestic bigwigs like Noise, Boat have already thrown their hat in the ring (pun unintended) and we could see fitness rings become a common sight in 2024.  The end of passwords? Yes, 2024 may just end up being the year when you finally say goodbye to the ever-infuriating password. Google has already introduced passkeys as has  . It is a matter of time before apps, websites and other services adopt passwords. High time as remembering that special character, symbol, upper-case, lower-case, more than 8 character and whatnot is getting taxing with every app you download.  Head (set) and go Apple’s next big thing — Vision Pro — arrives early 2024 and is set to usher in a new era of computing. Whether the ‘masses’ embrace it or not is secondary but you can guarantee that dozens of Chinese knockoffs will arrive and could just end up making headsets more mainstream. Meta’s Quest headset is also set to get an overhaul in 2024 and that’s also because it faces immense pressure from Apple Vision Pro. The Vision Pro is exorbitantly priced — $3,499 — and will initially be made available only in the US but its impact will be soon worldwide on multiple levels.  AI: Of course, we had to include it Artificial intelligence is no longer the stuff of sci-fi movies. In 2024, it will end infiltrating our lives in almost every walk of life. 2023 was perhaps just a trailer and the full movie is set to be released in 2024. Text to video is the one big leap AI will make in 2024. ChatGPT, Bard, Grok (yes, watch out for Elon Musk’s AI tool) and we will see a few more take big strides in 2024.

iPhone users facing cellular connectivity issues after installing iOS 17.2.1 update," rolled out the iOS 17.2.1 software update last month to deliver ""important bug fixes."" While rolling out the update, this is what Apple said in most countries. However, soon after the update was released, the Cupertino-based tech giant said that the update ""addresses an issue that can cause the battery to drain faster under certain conditions,” in both China and Japan. Now, a new report claims that iOS 17.2.1 did more than fix a battery-draining bug. How the latest update is affecting users According to a report by BGR, the latest update has also broken iPhone connectivity. The report claims that some users took to  Apple's Support Community Discussions  platform to complain that their iPhones were no longer able to connect with their cellular provider after their devices were updated to iOS 17.2.1. One iPhone user the update released to fix the battery from draining was causing their battery to drain. He wrote:  “After updating my iPhone last night to 17.2.1 I can no longer connect to my network provider. Tried the resets and still it does not work! Very frustrating. Trusted Apple and iPhone for years, now not so sure.”  Another user on the same site said: “After installing this update I’m facing heating and battery draining issues on my iPhone 15. Do we have any solution to this ?” This suggests that some iPhone 15 series handsets are also suffering from the ""thermal issues"" and are overheating once again.  Temporary workarounds to fix the issues The report also suggest some workaround which have been mentioned by iPhone users on the Apple Support Community Discussions website: Reset Network Settings: Go to  Settings  >  General  >  Transfer or Reset iPhone  >  Reset  >  Reset Network Settings . Factory Reset: Ensure that you have backed up your iPhone recently before doing this. Follow the above directions except instead of selecting Reset Network Settings at the end, erase everything. Delete all VPN profiles: Go to  Settings  >  General  >  VPN & Device Management  >  VPN  (tap the ""i"" in VPN profiles) >  Delete VPN . Users can also try installing the iOS 17.3 beta version which has also been rolled out. Since the iOS 17.3 public beta release was released before iOS 17.2.1, installing this version may rid users of the connectivity bug. How to download the latest iOS 17.3 public beta version Firstly, go to beta.apple.com. Tap the beta sign-up button and sign in using your Apple ID and password. Then go to  Settings  >  General  >  Software Update  and tap on the Beta Updates box near the top of the display. Select iOS 17 Public Beta and you will receive the latest iOS 17.3 public beta version to install.  However, before installing the iOS 17.3 public beta, users should remember that beta releases are unstable and they need to stay in the beta program until the final version of iOS 17.3 is released.

WhatsApp users will soon be able to share status updates to Instagram," is reportedly working on a new shortcut for better user experience. According to WABetaInfo, the Meta-owned app is working on a shortcut to share status updates to Instagram.  The report mentions that WhatsApp is gearing up to roll out a feature that recommends users to share their status updates on Instagram in the upcoming updates. Following the posting of a new status, users will be presented with a user-friendly shortcut encouraging them to share it on Instagram. It's worth emphasising that users retain the freedom to activate or deactivate this feature in the app settings, underscoring the voluntary nature of sharing status updates to Instagram.  Additionally, it's crucial to highlight that opting to share status updates on Instagram will consistently demand a manual selection of the shortcut, assuring users complete control over their sharing preferences. Another significant benefit of incorporating the capability to share status updates on Instagram is the potential for increased social reach and audience engagement. Enabling the simultaneous posting of status updates on both WhatsApp and Instagram empowers users to broaden the visibility of their content, reaching a wider audience across diverse platforms. WhatsApp rolls out new chat filter feature WhatsApp has recently introduced a new chat filter feature, aiming to assist users in organising their conversations by selecting a filter that aligns with their preferences.

"Apple faces legal troubles over its ‘deal’ with Visa, Mastercard","A class action lawsuit has accused  , Visa, and Mastercard of conspiring to limit competition for point-of-sale payment card services. According to Reuters, the lawsuit alleges that this has resulted in merchants paying higher fees for credit and debit transactions, which are artificially inflated.  Mirage Wine & Spirits, a beverage retailer in Illinois is suing companies on behalf of all merchants in the United States who accepted Apple Pay as a payment method at physical point-of-sale. The complaint claims that Apple made a deal with Visa and Mastercard, which eliminated any incentive for the company to create a competing point-of-sale transaction payment network or allow other companies to use the  's ""tap to pay"" NFC functionality with third-party wallet apps. And, Apple's own wallet app is the only option on the iPhone. This, according to the suit, has resulted in inflated merchant fees. According to the lawsuit, Visa and Mastercard offered a significant amount of ongoing cash to Apple in exchange for agreeing not to compete with them. This cash bribe was a percentage of the transaction fees for credit and debit card payments made with Apple Pay. The lawsuit alleges that these payments are essentially a ""large and ongoing cash bribe,"" amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars annually. The lawsuit seeks to hold these companies accountable for their actions and ensure fair competition in the marketplace. This is not the only lawsuit on Apple over its payment system. Apple has also been sued by payment card issuers for forcing iPhone users to use its Apple Pay mobile wallet, with Venmo and Cash App accusing Apple of stifling competition for peer-to-peer payments. A US judge has recently ordered Apple to face these allegations in court. Last year EU antitrust regulators have also accused Apple of hindering rivals' access to tap-and-go technology. Though, Apple has reportedly offered its mobile payments systems to its competitors to resolve EU charges.  Visa and Mastercard faced a lawsuit over transaction fees. An appeals court upheld a $5.6 billion antitrust settlement with more than 12 million retailers claiming that the companies unlawfully fixed credit and debit card fees.

"Whaling attack: What is it, consequences, security tips to stay safe from whaling attacks, and more","Whaling attacks are a sophisticated form of cybercrime that specifically targets high-profile individuals within organisations, such as executives or decision-makers. Unlike traditional phishing attacks, whaling is highly targeted and aims to deceive top-tier personnel to gain access to sensitive company information or financial assets. Here are a few tips that organisations can follow to mitigate the risk of whaling attacks: Educating and raising awareness among employees: Provide training to staff, particularly high-level executives, about the attributes of whaling attacks. Train them to recognize suspicious requests or anomalies in communication and emphasise the importance of verifying unusual or sensitive requests through alternate means. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA): Employ robust security measures like MFA to add an extra layer of protection to sensitive accounts, preventing unauthorised access even if credentials are compromised. Email authentication protocols: Utilise email authentication protocols to detect and prevent email spoofing, reducing the risk of unauthorised access through deceptive emails. Regular security audits: Conduct routine security audits and assessments to identify vulnerabilities and gaps in the organisation's cybersecurity measures. Promptly address these weaknesses to strengthen defences against whaling attacks. Incident response plan: Craft a detailed incident response plan that delineates procedures for managing suspected whaling attacks. This plan needs to incorporate procedures for reporting, investigating, and mitigating potential breaches. How do whaling attacks work? Whaling attacks employ various methods, including email spoofing, social engineering, and impersonation tactics. Cybercriminals often craft convincing emails impersonating CEOs or other trusted sources, requesting urgent transfers of funds or sensitive company data under the guise of critical business matters. What is email spoofing in the context of whaling attacks? Email spoofing involves cybercriminals crafting emails that impersonate trusted sources within an organisation, such as CEOs, board members, or financial officers. These emails typically request urgent actions, such as fund transfers or sharing sensitive company information, exploiting the trust placed in high-ranking individuals. Why are whaling attacks a significant threat to organisations? Whaling attacks pose a significant threat because they target high-value individuals with access to sensitive information or financial assets. The targeted nature of these attacks makes them more challenging to detect, and successful whaling attacks can result in severe financial and reputational damage to organisations. How can organisations enhance their overall cybersecurity posture against whaling attacks? By combining robust technical defences with comprehensive employee training and awareness programs, organisations can significantly reduce the risk posed by whaling attacks. Remaining vigilant, fostering education, and implementing proactive measures are essential in protecting against these focused and potentially severe cybersecurity threats.

What is Garmin’s Body Battery feature? How does it work? What are its benefits?,"Garmin Smartwatch brand   stands out as a leading brand in fitness tracking, known for its dedicated user base and emphasis on practical devices with reliable metrics, prioritising usability over unnecessary features. One notable aspect contributing to Garmin's appeal is its software, which provides effective means to interpret fitness data. A prominent feature is Body Battery, a scoring system aimed at informing users about their energy reserves before engaging in a workout. Here are all the details related to the functionality of Garmin Body Battery. What is Garmin’s Body Battery feature? Garmin Body Battery is a feature available on various Garmin devices that provides insights into your energy levels and readiness for training. It combines heart rate variability (HRV), stress, activity data, and sleep information to generate a numerical score between 1 and 100, indicating your likely energy reserves. How are Garmin Body Battery levels categorised? Garmin Body Battery measures energy reserves on a scale of 0-100: 0-25 is Low, 26-50 is Medium, 51-75 is High, and 76-100 is Very high. How does Garmin Body Battery work? Garmin Body Battery uses HRV as a key metric, measuring sympathetic nervous system dominance. It combines HRV data with stress information derived from it. Activity levels, sleep data, and cumulative data are also considered to provide a comprehensive view of your energy reserves. What contributes to the Garmin Body Battery score? The score is influenced by HRV, stress, activity levels, and sleep data. Cumulative data is crucial, and the feature considers your overall lifestyle patterns rather than focusing on individual days. Can Garmin Body Battery help with training decisions? Yes, many users find it to be an accurate representation of their energy levels, aiding in decision-making about the intensity of training. It helps prevent overtraining and promotes better energy management. What improvements were made with the Garmin Venu 2 series? The Garmin Venu 2 series introduced algorithm improvements based on user feedback, making it more challenging to achieve a Body Battery score of 100. What are the limitations of Garmin Body Battery? While useful, Garmin Body Battery has limitations. It primarily reflects HRV, and other factors affecting readiness to train, such as injuries or illness, may not be fully captured. The feature also requires consistent device wear, including at night, for accurate results. Which Garmin devices support Body Battery? Garmin Body Battery is available on various devices, including the Garmin Venu 3, Forerunner series, Fenix series, Instinct series, Venu series, vivoactive series, and more. It's compatible with a wide range of Garmin products. How long does it take for Garmin Body Battery to adapt to user habits? It typically takes 5-7 days for the device to learn your habits and provide more accurate Body Battery scores based on your individual lifestyle patterns. Are there alternatives to Garmin Body Battery on the market? Yes, similar features are available on other devices, such as the Oura Ring 3, WHOOP Strap, and Fitbit with its Daily Readiness Score, each providing HRV-based readiness assessments.

Former highest-paid executive at Google is now a billionaire Silicon Valley CEO,"He became the highest-paid executive at  , got a fat cheque when he was poached by the SoftBank Group became the world’s best-paid executive and now he has stepped into the list of billionaires after his current company, Palo Alto Networks, rode the boom in the cybersecurity software industry. Nikesh Arora’s net worth now stands at $1.5 billion. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Arora is also a rare non-founder billionaire tech CEO. When Palo Alto Networks hired him in 2018, it gave Arora $125 million in stocks. As cybersecurity software became more relevant for businesses following a series of high-profile hacking incidents, the company’s share price jumped more than four times the original value with Arora’s stake now worth $830 million. These stocks combined with pay awards in his career and more than 3.4 million options that were awarded to him when joining the firm, his net worth is now about $1.5 billion. Arora sold nearly $300 million worth of shares in 2023 after exercising some of the options, the report said. Arora continues to build his fortune Arora will further amass fortune at Palo Alto Networks as his 2023 compensation includes a maximum of 750,000 stocks, which would currently be worth more than $220 million.  In a proxy statement, the company said the award was justified because of Arora’s strong performance over his first five years. This reportedly means that he had already been able to vest “$102 million of value each year.” “Because of this significant vested ownership and the amount that Mr Arora was projected to vest in over the next several years, the Board determined that a meaningful equity award would be necessary to ensure that such award retains and engages Mr Arora,” the company was quoted as saying.

Google fixes issue with Chrome 'malware' that allowed to break into users' accounts,"Recently it was reported that there were several malware families engaged in information theft and were exploiting an unreported Google OAuth endpoint called ""MultiLogin."" According to a report by Bleeping Computer, the endpoint enabled malware to renew expired authentication cookies and gain unauthorised access to users' accounts, even in cases where the account password has been reset. Now, according to a report by 9to5 , Google has fixed the issue. “Google is aware of recent reports of a malware family stealing session tokens. Attacks involving malware that steal cookies and tokens are not new; we routinely upgrade our defenses against such techniques and to secure users who fall victim to malware. In this instance, Google has taken action to secure any compromised accounts detected,” said Google as per the report.  Furthermore, Google has clarified that there was a misconception regarding stolen cookies. “It’s important to note a misconception in reports that suggests stolen tokens and cookies cannot be revoked by the user. This is incorrect, as stolen sessions can be invalidated by simply signing out of the affected browser, or remotely revoked via the user’s devices page,” said Google. The company also said that it will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as needed. The report by Bleeping Computer had noted that even after a user resets their Google Account password, malicious actors can exploit this vulnerability once again to gain unauthorised access to the compromised account. Google has said that this was a misconception and that if a user signs of an affected browser — like Chrome or any other — then the stolen sessions automatically become invalidated.  Google also said that users should continually take steps to remove any malware from their computer, “and we recommend turning on Enhanced Safe Browsing in Chrome to protect against phishing and malware downloads.” Facebook Twitter Linkedin end of article 6 9 7 7 7 12 8 6 7 11 9 12",Tech,"Google fixes issue with Chrome 'malware' that allowed to break into users' accounts Recently it was reported that there were several malware families engaged in information theft and were exploiting an unreported Google OAuth endpoint called ""MultiLogin.""
